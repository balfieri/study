Position reports are also required when passing over each reporting point used in a flight plan to define a direct route, and when requested by ATC.
Either: When vacating an altitude, reaching or leaving a holding fix, changing altitude when VFR-on-top, initiating a missed approach, TAS change of 10 knot or 5%, unable to maintain 500 fpm, safety of flight information, weather different than forecast, and equipment malfunctions.
When not in radar contact, the following additional reports are required:  leaving the FAF inbound on an approach, when the ETA needs to be revised more than 3 minutes, or when passing over a compulsory reporting point.

Only a state-issued driverâs license is required to be carried for the purpose of operating under BasicMed.

The Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist and the FAA BasicMed Medical Education Course completion certificate must be kept and made available if requested by the FAA.
