can use simulator after 6 months alone?

problems with filing direct, particularly over mountains: off-route, lost comms, gonna get a different clearance anyway, not ideal for traffic flow, unpublished hold above dest, recommended route is not necessarily safe, maybe add IAF to route even have to hold there

zig zag line through airway means it is closed, usually due to lack of VOR coverage along that radial

how to calc VPD?
AGL/300 = nm

delay vectors or box vectors

A NA - not auth as alternate

if backup instrument is inop, need to look at STC for plane, which will likely say must have it

reverse sensing is when CDI shows aircraft relative to course rather than VOR relative to course?

WAAS: ground stations send info to master station that beams corrections to geostationary satellites that then send you the corrected info


when should we look for LPV vs. LNAV etc.?


need to thoroughly read supplements for our aircraft

does garmin have a g5 app?

engine intake air blocked, what is effect?

red x over AHRS
red X if ADC went bad

understand what POH says  about dealing with icing conditions

how often winds aloft comes out?

how to know gps is airworthy?

memorize MARVELOUS VFR C500

can foreflight help me understand my ETA situation?

how do you account for things not in your flight plan? like route changes, etc.


EMAS

green square around bravo

two H's

how is class D shown on chart?

leave clearance limit?

always file to point on approach that has a hold; this way, you know to hold there or continue the approach with lost comms

limitations of weather tools on the airplane

how far in advance may you pick up your IFR clearance?

bring binder with everything organized

do not declare emergency if only one G5 out

can't do rnav GPS if no HSI; need to request ILS

you CAN fly a DME arc without DME, so long as you use GPS for navigation during the arc before switching to VOR on the straight in portion

you do not need a transponder to fly ifr, but atc gives a squawk code, so???

What are the ranges for a Localizer and Glideslope? How far can you pick up the signal?

What are the standard alternate minimums for an airport with only GPS approaches? What if they have an LPV approach that takes you to 200ft HAT?

You are currently at 15000ft. ATC informs you to maintain 300kts, descend pilots disretion, and maintain 7000. What do you do?

TAF radius is 5 SM

LPV vs LNAV/VNAV precision

the leans leads to graveyard spiral 

MOSAIC rules

illusions will always be an issue

no weather reporting today, can still fly an iap?

elevator illusion
