{chart} on sectional chart, blue airport with no airspace boundary markers
controlled class G airport that is in the process of becoming a class D airport, treat it as class D during landings

{sys} cause of carburator icing
vaporization of fuel combined with expansion of air causes a sudden cooling of the mixture, water is squeezed out and could freeze

{sys} indications of carburator icing
gradual drop in RPM in fixed-propeller engine or gradual drop in manifold pressure in constant-speed propeller engine

{sys} how to know if carburator icing has been eliminated
when heat is first applied, there will be a drop in RPM, then rise, and then engine should run more smoothly

{sys} conditions favorable to carburator icing
temperatures below 70F, at least 80% humidity

{sys} anti-icing equipment

{sys} how does altimeter work

{sys} limitations of pressure altimeter
on warm day pressure level is higher than on standard day; if surface pressure is higher than standard day then altimeter indicates lower than actual

{sys} how does airspeed indicator work
differential pressure gauge that compares ram air pressure from the pitot tube with static pressure

{sys} limitation of airspeed indicator
subject to proper flow of air through the pitot/static system

{sys} errors of airspeed indicator
position error caused by static ports sensing wrong static pressure, density error caused by temperature and altitude not compensated for by the instrument, compressibility error caused by packing of air into the pitot tube at high airspeeds resulting in higher than normal indications

{sys} limitations of vertical speed indicator
not accurate until aircraft is control-stabilized in non-turbulent air

{sys} which instruments contain gyroscopes
turn coordinator, heading indicator, attitude indicator

{sys} two fundamental properties of a gyroscope
rigidity in space (fixed position in plane in which it is spinning), precession (tilting or turning of gyro in response to deflection forces)

{sys} power sources for gyros
vacuum, pressure, electric

{sys} how attitude indicator works
rotates in the horizontal plane and operates off of the principle of rigidity in space, aircraft pitches and rolls around the erect gyroscope, effects of precession are not felt because pendulous vanes attached to the base of the gyro duct high pressure air from the vacuum through small doors that open and close by the force of gravity to keep the gyro in its original position

{sys} errors in attitude indicator
may be slight nose up during acceleration, also may be bank/pitch angle error after 180-degree turn

{sys} how the heading indicator works
rotates in the vertical plane and operates off of rigidity in space, as the aircraft yaws around the gyro, a gear inside of the instrument case rotates the compass card to show the magnetic direction, precession caused from aircraft movement and friction causes error that must be corrected by resetting the heading indicator to the magnetic compass approximately every 15 minutes

{sys} errors in heading indicator
precession caused by friction, needs to be checked every 15 min

{sys} how turn coordinator works
uses precession, gyro reacts to movement during a turn

{sys} turn coordinator shows...
roll and yaw of aircraft around the vertical and longitudinal axes, standard rate turn of 3-deg per second

{sys} what turn coordinator shows during slip
ball on inside of the turn, not enough rate of turn for bank

{sys} what turn coordinator shows during skid
ball on outside of the turn, too much rate of turn for the bank

{sys} how does magnetic compass work
magnetized needles attached to a float assembly in bowl of acid-free white kerosine

{sys} limitations of magnetic compass

maximum permissible altimeter error in ft
75

two situations where indicated altitude is higher than true altitude
temperature less than 15C, fly from high pressure to low pressure without adjusting altimeter setting

when difference between IAS and CAS is largest, and why
at slow speeds, higher angle of attack against pitot tube so IAS has more error

typical errors that can occur when selecting alternate static source in unpressurized aircraft
IAS will be higher, altitude will be higher, VSI will be momentarily positive

why there are errors when selecting alternate static source in unpressurized aircraft, how to handle
static pressure inside cockpit is lower than outside due to Venturi effect, consult POH tables

load factor
total load on wings divided by weight of aircraft

factors that increase load factors
turns, abrupt back pressure, turbulent air

reason aircraft pitches down when power is reduced
less prop wash that strikes top of horizontal stabilizer

reason airplane has positive stability on lateral axis
aircraft resists being displaced around lateral axis of pitch because center of gravity is forward of center of lift while downward pressure on tail acts as balancing force

reason airplane has positive stability on longitudinal axis
wing dihedral which is slight upward slope of wing from wing root to wing tip

how airplane maintains pitch stability when nose is pointed down
increase in speed increases downward force on top of horizontal stabilizer

cause of loss in longitudinal stability
when bank angle exceeds medium bank, creating an over-banking tendency as outside wing travels faster, causing steeper roll

purposes of flaps
lower stall speed, increase drag

why pilot must increase pitch during a bank
to increase total lift in order to increase vertical lift component so as to maintain level flight

region of reverse command
occurs at speeds below minimum, as speed decreases further, drag increases exponentially

with constant bank angle, effect of decrease in speed on rate and radius of turn
rate increases, radius decreases

effect of trimming nose up
trim tab deflected downward, elevator pushed upward, tail pushed downward

purposes of rudder in single-engine airplane
counteract adverse yaw, counteract left-turning tendencies, coordinate flight, taxi turning, spin recovery

purpose of AUTO button on audio panel
to automatically listen on the radio on which you are talking

advantage of solid-state AHRS

how altimeter works
measures difference between static pressure inside of the instrument case and standard pressure (29.92) sealed inside of an aneroid wafer

how does the vertical speed indicator work
measures the difference between static pressure and static pressure that is subject to a calibrated leak approximately every 6-9 seconds

gyro rigidity in space
while spinning, a gyroscope will tend to stay fixed in its plane of rotation, like a bicycle wheel, with enough momentum you are able to stay naturally balanced

gyro precession
when a force is applied to a gyroscope, the resultant force is felt 90° ahead in the direction of the rotation

how turn coordinator works
electrically powered gyro rotates in the vertical plane and it uses precession to measure rate of turn and rate of roll, when the aircraft yaws, the gyro precesses and the airplane on the face of the instrument indicates the direction and rate of the turn. Notice in the diagram of the instrument that it is slightly canted upwards (this is so rate of roll can be indicated as well), when the aircraft begins a bank the aircraft will also indicate the direction of the bank, if it is a rapid roll the airplane will respond by banking more steeply, once the turn is established it will properly indicate the rate of the turn

what cools the engine
air intakes at the front of the engine cowling allow outside air to cool the cylinders, fins on the filters allow a greater surface area to be exposed and thus cooled by the air, engine oil is crucial in internal engine cooling

meaning of four-stroke engine
intake valve opens as downward moving piston pulls fuel/air mixture into cylinder, while this piston is in its upmost position the spark plugs ignite the mixture and force the piston back down, as the piston rises, the exhaust valve opens and expels the exhaust gas from the cylinder

problems with excessive fuel/air mixture as altitude increases
can result in carbon build up in the cylinders which can foul the spark plugs and reduce engine power

resulting color if different aviation fuel types are mixed
clear

what types of aviation fuel are naturally clear
Jet A

how a vacuum system works
engine driven vacuum pump creates suction, air is pulled through a filter and then directed to the instrument case, rotor vanes on the gyros catch the air like a water wheel and cause it to rotate at a high speed, in some aircraft there is also an electrical vacuum pump to be used as a backup

cumulus stage of a thunderstorm
the building stage of a thunderstorm characterized by updrafts only, all thunderstorms begin as cumulus clouds but not all cumulus clouds become thunderstorms

mature stage of a thunderstorm
updrafts and downdrafts both occur at this point, violent turbulence can be experienced if flight is attempted beneath a cumulonimbus cloud because of this shear zone, the mature stage can be recognized by the beginning of rainfall

dissipating stage of a thunderstorm
at this point the cloud is only giving off downdrafts and the thunderstorm is dissipating, during this stage large cumulonimbus clouds may have a recognizable “anvil top” that is a portion of the cloud that has been sheared off by the jet stream, the direction in which the anvil top is facing also shows the direction in which the storm is moving

body systems used to ascertain our orientation and movement in space
vestibular, somatosensory, visual

vestibular system
the inner ear system is composed of 3 semicircular hollow but fluid filled canals arranged in the pitch, roll, and yaw axes, this endolymph fluid inside the canals moves when the head or body moves and displaces tiny hair cells that stimulate nerve impulses, these signals are then sent to the brain and interpreted as motion

somatosensory system
the nerves in our skin cells, this is basically “flying by the seat of your pants” or the sensations of motion that we feel in our bodies from acceleration or turning

visual system
our eyes, light from the sun is constantly being reflected by everything on Earth, this light enters the eyeball through the cornea, travels through the lens and falls on the photoreceptors of the retina, the two kinds of photoreceptors are rods and cones, rods are used for night and peripheral vision, cones are used to sense color

cause of middle ear pain in flight
air inside of the middle ear is normally equalized through the Eustachian tube: a tube that travels from the ear to the back of the throat on each side, if there is any kind of congestion or blockage it makes this equalization difficult or impossible, in a climb, the air outside becomes less dense and the trapped higher pressure air in the middle ear tends to expand, in a descent, the trapped air is of lower pressure than the outside air and feeling of compression is experienced, this is typically more painful and more difficult to resolve, sinus congestions cause pain from similar circumstances and can be very painful, 

how to mitigate middle ear pain
first step in avoiding this pain is to not fly with head colds or ear/sinus infections, in flight equalization can be helped along by swallowing, yawning, tensing the throat muscles, or by executing the Valsalva maneuver, accomplished by pinching the nostrils, closing the mouth, and attempting to exhale, oral decongestions do not provide adequate relief and may have adverse side effects

how to determine if another aircraft is at the same altitude
use the horizon as a refernce

where to find weight and balance for a specific aircraft
usually attached to the Flight Manual or POH

what to expect if you have to make a no-flaps landing
landing with the flaps up requires about 10 knot faster approach, you can expect to come in "shallower," the landing roll will be longer due to the higher speed and due to the lack of aerodynamic braking effect from the extended flaps

where to find FAA specified aircraft limitations
POH, attachments to the Airworthiness Certificate, markings on instruments, or instrument panel placards

name two things that you can do before the flight (on the ground) to help minimize the chance of a mid-air collision while in the air
clean the windshield, organize the cockpit and information as far as possible

practical aerodynamic effects of operating with a center of gravity at the forward-most legal position
as the CG position moves toward the forward limit the aircraft becomes more longitudinally stable, the elevator controls will feel heavier, requiring more muscle power to move them, pitch response will also become sluggish increasing the likelihood of accidents such as landing on the nose wheel, a more stable aircraft will be easier to trim for steady flight

maximum power mixture setting
slightly richer than maximum economy setting, it is approximately +50F to the rich side of EGT

what to notice when removing the fuel cap
if there is a sudden rush of air when the cap is being cracked open, there could be a serious blockage in the vent system

the oil pressure gauge changes more quickly than the oil temperature gauge (yes/no)
yes, oil takes more time to heat up or cool down

what sits between crankshaft and piston
connecting rod

{sys} 172SP fuel system
2 tanks, fuel flows from each wing by gravity to selector valve (which should be one BOTH for takeoff and landing and normally), fuel goes through electrically powered auxilliary fuel pump bypassing the shutoff valve, then flows through the fuel strainer and the engine driven fuel pump into the fuel/air control unit, the fuel/air mixture (ratio governed by mixture control, air governed by throttle) then flows through the fuel distribution valve into the cylinders

exhaust gas temperature gauge (EGT)
measurement of internal combustion temperature of the engine, indirectly related to the quality of the fuel/air mixture entering the engine

five positions of light aircraft ignition switch
off, right, left, both, start

maximum economy or lean mixture setting
usually at about maximum EGT (consult POH)

engine baffles
thin and lightweight pieces of metal or other material whose job it is to route intake air over fins attached to the engine cylinders

full rich setting
maximum amount of fuel possible is entering the engine, provides cooling and rapid throttle response, could cause roughness at high altitudes

wet sump vs. dry sump oil system
in wet sump (most common in light aircraft) oil is located in a sump and is an integral part of the engine (pump circulates oil between sump and engine), in dry sump oil is contained in a separate tank and circulated through the engine via pumps (allows for higher volume of oil to be pumped in and out of the engine for very large reciprocating engines)

what would happen to a reciprocating engine designed for 100LL fuel if Jet A fuel were used
it may start and run, but will fail from detonation

best way to prevent water from condensing in your aircraft's fuel tanks
completely fill tanks with proper grade after each flight or at least after the last flight of the day

when permissible to use automotive fuel as a substitute
only if a supplemental type certificate (STC) has been issued to allow its use

what happens if pilot forgets to enrichen mixture prior to descent
mixture would become too lean and engine would begin to run rough and could stall if pilot attempts a go-around

service ceiling for single engine is when can climb at least this many fpm
50

design maneuvering speed (Va)
the speed below which you can move a single flight control, one time, to its full deflection, for one axis of airplane rotation only (pitch, roll or yaw), in smooth air, without risk of damage to the airplane

flying from a high pressure area to a low pressure area without adjusting the altimeter while maintaining a constant indicated altitude would result in a
loss of true altitude

low density air vs. efficiency
Increases efficiency because, as the aircraft flies, there are fewer air molecules "in its way" and thus there is less drag created and the aircraft does not have to work as hard to go a given distance

when an aircraft is flying where it is colder than standard temperature, the altimeter indicates
higher than true altitude

a pilot flies at a constant indicated altitude from an area of low pressure and high temperature to an area of high pressure and low temperature, which means true altitude will be
indeterminant

effects of temperature changes on aircraft performance
in hot weather, with high density altitude, the airplane will be more efficient and move through the air faster, but will have reduced performance characteristics (lower climb rate for example)

standard empty weight
consists of the airframe, engines, and all items of operating equipment that have fixed locations and are permanently installed in the aircraft, including fixed ballast, hydraulic fluid, unusable fuel, and full engine oil

basic empty weight
standard empty weight plus the weight of optional and special equipment that have been installed

reasons you might be restricted to a gross (operational) weight less than the published max gross weight
high density altitude, high-drag or high-friction conditions caused by wet grass or water on the runway

not following ATC instructions, losing orientation during taxiing, communication errors

special consideration to be given when either hypoxia or hyperventilation is suspected in an aircraft that supplies supplemental oxygen
change regulator to deliver 100% oxygen, then check the system

action to take if pilot is forced to use white light in the cockpit while flying at night
keep the other eye closed so as to retain its night vision adaptedness

how to learn about your hypoxia symtoms
attend the Physiological Training Program at the Air Aeromedical Institude in Oklahoma City

spatial orientation
natural ability to maintain body orientation and/or posture in relation to the surrounding environment at rest and during motion

things that can cause false horizon illusion
sloping cloud formation, obscured horizon, aurora borealis, dark scene spread with ground lights and stars, certain geometric patterns of ground lights

why pilots should be particularly concerned about hypoxia at night
even as low as 5000 ft a pilot can begin to lose night vision (effectiveness of rods) due to altitude or hypoxia

actions to take if passenger is airsick
talk to passenger, make sickness bag available, provide ventilation, allow passenger to place hands on the controls to help feel what aircraft is doing next, make more gradual control changes, perhaps land somewhere to take a break

reasons why new safety features and technology don't seem to be lowering the accident rate much in general aviation
pilots tend use new safety equipment to increase/embolden their levels of tolerable risk (risk homeostatis)

part of body to which most cases or disorientation are traced
inner ear, which is similar to a three-axis gyro, it reacts only to rate of change not sustained change

time of useful consciousness
maximum time a pilot has to make rational, life-saving decisions and carry them out at a given altitude without supplemental oxygen (e.g., only 3-6 minutes at 25000 ft)

vertigo
inner ear sends incorrect spatial information to the brain and there is a corresponding loss of balance or situational awareness

conditions in which pilots are particularly susceptible to vertigo
IMC, dark night flying conditions

ear block is more dangerous to a pilot than a sinus infection (yes/no)
yes, sinus infection will become painful during assent (can lower altitude) while ear block manifests itself during descent

how to tell if a person has hyperventilation vs. hypoxia by looking at them
turning red vs. turning blue

symptoms of hypoxia particularly above 15000 ft
periphery of visual field grays out (tunnel vision), blue coloration of fingernails and lips

why pilots should focus on small areas of the sky during scans
fovea (sharpest part of retina) has very narrow field of view

in haze, pilot will tend to be too high on final approach to landing (yes/no)
no, haze creates an illusion of being at a greater distance from the runway, so the pilot will believe that the aircraft is higher than it is

if a commercial airliner has a pressurized cabin at 5000 ft but is flying at 30000 ft, the SCUBA rules say to wait 12 hours (yes/no)
no, the wait rules apply to flight altitude not cabin pressure altitude, so wait 24 hours

reasons class E is considered a controlled airspace
ATC provides separation services to participating IFR aircraft and to VFR aircraft with flight following

reasons some airports do not allow SVFR
volume of IFR traffic

you may proceed into class C airspace if ATC says "<tailnumber>, standby" (yes/no)
yes, radio communications have been established

you may proceed into class C airspace if ATC says "standby" (yes/no)
no, radio communications are established only if ATC mentions your tail number

what to do when ATC gives you a heading that looks as if it will lead into storm clouds
say "unable to comply" and suggest an alternative

a class B ATC gives you squawk code and then says radar contact established, you may now enter class B airspace (yes/no)
no, you must receive explicit clearance to enter

it is possible to fly under SVFR in class G airspace (yes/no)
no, SVFR requires an ATC clearance which is not available in class G

class B controller has you fly a heading at night that gets you within 2000 ft of clouds, you should...
continue to fly the heading because you need only be clear of clouds

at or below 10000 ft, VFR weather minimums for class E are the same as for class C and D (yes/no)
yes

radius of typical outer area of class C airspace
20 nm (the outer area is not he same as the outer core or shelf area)

special exception for aircraft operating at night within pattern for class G
1-3 SM visibility, within 1/2 mile of runway, clear of clouds

if a pilot has VFR flight following and crosses an airway, ATC has primary responsibility for collision avoidance (yes/no)

which airspace classes require explicit clearance from ATC to enter
A, B

it is legal to fly at 8500 ft above class B that extends to 8000 ft if you are flying above a cloud (yes/no)

why pilots should periodically monitor 121.5 MHz while in-flight
to assist in identifying possible emergency ELT transmissions

fuel-related things to check in an aircraft after a loss of power
position of fuel tank selector, quantity of fuel in selected tank, fuel pressure gauge, position of fuel mixture, position of magneto switch, use of carburator heat

meaning of "minimum fuel" declaration to ATC
aircraft can accept little or no delay at its destination, not an emergency situation yet

you land safely in the wilderness, but there's no cell phone coverage, actions that you should take
manually activate your ALT, consider carrying a SAT-based GPS locator in the future

distress situation vs. urgency situation
emergency can be either, but pilots typically do not hesitate to declare an emergency when in a distress situation, but not necessarily in an urgency situation

what to do if ATC advises you to squawk MAYDAY
set transponder code to 7700

when a pilot may deviate from an FAA regulation
in an emergency situation requiring immediate action

if you have an emergency and are already on a CTAF frequency, you should first try to alert those on CTAF rather than immediately switching to 121.5 (yes/no)
no, switch to 121.5 where there is a higher chance of getting an emergency response

first steps when inadvertently entering IMC
recognition of seriousness (a leading cause of fatal accidents), maintain control of the aircraft, obtain proper assistance to get the aircraft on the ground

if you have an emergency and are already talking to a class D tower, you should switch to 121.5 to declare the emergency (yes/no)
no, stay with ATC

typical steps in responding to an electrical fire
remove power from all electrical systems, close air ducts from engine, open overhead vents, consider not turning on electrical equipment, land as soon as possible

during emergency, pilot is given priority by ATC, describe conditions under which pilot should submit a written report
upon request by ATC, submit written report to the ATC manager

pilot deviates from an ATC clearance in order to deal with an emergency, describe steps to take to notify ATC
notify ATC as soon as possible and obtain an amended clearance

what to do if strong headwinds decrease your ground speed much more than anticipated, increasing the likelihood of running out of fuel
turn back to the nearest airport with fuel, headwinds will become tailwinds

magnetic course vs. magnetic heading
magnetic course does not account for wind

VFR altitudes are based on magnetic course, not true heading or magnetic heading (yes/no)
yes

a class C airspace extended to 4100 ft, a transponder is never required above this airspace (yes/no)
no, it is required above 10000 ft

you plan to fly over level terrain at 2800 ft MSL in class E, TC is 188 deg, MV is 12 deg east, BLK070, determine highest you may legally fly
clouds are at 9800 ft, so you must be at least 500 ft below clouds, so 9300 ft MSL, mag course is 176 deg, so 7500 ft MSL is highest odd+500ft altitude

how to file a flight plan when a stopover is anticipated
file a separate flight plan for each leg when the stop is expected to be more than 1 hour in duration

common errors when practicing power-off accuracy landings
failure to lower landing gear (when applicable), attempting to stretch a glide, premature flap extension, premature landing gear extension, use of throttle to increase glide instead of merely clearing the engine (briefly advancing throttle to normal cruise), forcing airplane onto the runway to avoid overshoot

stabilized approach
approach in which pilot maintains a constant angle glidepath toward a predetermined point on the runway

when bank is steepest in S-turns across a road
when beginning the turn on the downwind side of the road

reason flaps are generally recommended during soft-field landing
aid in touching down at minimum speed

reason why one would not want to use flaps during a soft-field landing
in low-wing airplanes, the flaps may suffer damage from mud, stones, or slush being thrown up by the wheels

three phases of a spin 
incipient spin, fully-developed spin, spin recovery

two dangers of operating an engine in-flight at idle speed for a prolonged time, recommended action
excessive engine cooling and spark plug fouling, clear the engine by briefly advancing the throttle to normal cruise power

action pilot should take if strong ballooing occurs upon landing
execute an immediate go-around before the plane stalls

accelerated stall
any stall that occurs higher than the expected Vso

causes of accelerated stalls
airplane is heavier than max gross weight, airplane is flying uncoordinated, less flaps out than published with Vso, atmosphere less dense than published for Vso, load factor greater than speed for which the speed was published

what to do if you encounter unexpected traffic in the middle of steep turns
immediately stop doing the maneuver and ensure safe separation from the traffic (duh!)

special considerations for planning an approach and landing in turbulent conditions
fly slightly faster than normal speeds (e.g., +5 kts)

why aircrafts don't always stall when you are below the bottom of the white arc
below max gross weight, air is more dense

common errors while performing power-off and power-on stalls
failure to clear the area, inability to recognize stall using feel, premature recovery, over-reliance on airspeed indicator, inadequate scanning resulting in wing-low condition, excessive back-elevator pressure, inadequate rudder control, secondary stall during recovery, failure to maintain constant bank angle during turning stalls, excessive forward-elevator pressure during recovery resulting in negative load on wings, excessive airspeed buildup during recovery, failure to take timely action to prevent a full stall during the conduct of imminent stalls

common errors while perfoming slow flight
failure to clear the area, inadequate back-elevator pressure resulting in altitude loss, excessive back-elevator pressure resulting in climb, inadequate compensation for adverse yaw during turns, fixation on airspeed indicator, failure to anticipate changes in lift as flaps are extended, inadequate power management, inability to divide time between aircraft control and orientation

secondary stall occurs when
there is incomplete recovery from an initial stall, such as not lowering the nose enough

action pilot should take if slight ballooning occurs during landing
maintain attitude, possibly add a little throttle to help cushion the landing

speed instability as it pertains the slow flight
airspeed will decrease if the airplane is disturbed by even the slightest turbulence, drag will then increase resulting in further loss of speed, and this decay will continue until the aircraft stalls

action if speed instability occurs due to turbulence
increase power

common errors during a go-around
failure to recognize the need to do a go-around, indecision, delay, failure to apply max power in a timely manner, abrupt power application, improper pitch attitude, failure to reconfigure the aircraft (e.g., for takeoff trim, flaps), attempting to climb out of ground effect prematurely, failure to apply right rudder to compensate for torque/p-factor

corrective action if airplane bounces back into the air upon landing
same as for ballooning, depends on severity (go-around or slight increase in power)

problem with touching down while in a crab or drift
extreme sideways load on landing gear, increasing chances of structural failure

steps to recover from a spiral dive
throttle idle, wings level, gradually raise nose to level flight altitude

common errors in performance of rectangular course maneuver
failure to clear the area, failure to establish proper altitude prior to entry, failure to apply appropriate wind correction angle, gaining or losing altitude, poor coordination, abrupt control usage, inability to divide attention between control and maintaining ground track, improper timing in beginning and recovery from turns, inadequate checking for other aircraft

how to position controls if wing starts to rise during a landing roll
apply more aileron pressure toward the high wing

minimum slow flight climb allowed by regulations
none

common errors in the performance of steep turns
failure to clear the area, excessive pitch during entry or recovery, attempts to start recovery prematurely, failure to stop the turn on proper heading, excessive rudder during recovery resulting in skidding, inadequate power management, inadequate airspeed control, poor coordination, losing altitude in left turns, gaining altitude in right turns, failure to maintain constant bank angle, disorientation, attempting to perform the maneuver by instrument reference rather than visual reference, failure to scan for other traffic during the maneuver

where to turn more than 90 degrees on a rectangular course

where to turn less than 90 degrees on a rectangular course
base to upwind (final), upwind to crosswind

how to estimate wind direction and speed while perform9ing a power-off emergency landing
look at windsock

common errors in the performance of crosswind landings
crosswinds that exceed the maximum demonstrated crosswind component reported in the POH, inadequate compensation for wind drift when turning base to final, inadequate compensation for wind drift when on final approach, unstabilized approach, failure to compensate for increased drag during side slip resulting in faster descent, touchdown while drifting, touchdown while crabbed, excessive airspeed on touchdown, failure to apply appropriate control inputs during rollout, failure to maintain direction control on rollout, excessive braking

wheelbarrowing
condition that occurs when pilot allows airplane weight to become concentrated about the nosewheel, resulting in less control with main wheels particularly during crosswind conditions

main cause of wheelbarrowing
simultaneous touchdown of main wheels and nose wheel, with excessive speed, followed by forward pressure on the elevator control

when is ground effect most significant
when airplane (especially low-wing) is maintaining constant attitude at low airspeed during takeoff/landing

most likely negative outcome when pilot tries to control porpoising by controlling pitch and power to try to land
they won't be able to time them with the oscillations and will only make the situation worse

why braking should be avoided during soft-field landings
may cause the nosewheel to dig in

common errors in performance of short-field landings
misjudgement of wind, incorrect speed, unstabilized approach, poor roundout to flare, insufficient flaps, power power management, failure to idle the engine, hard touchdown, inadequate transfer of weight to main wheels during touchdown, too much application of brakes at too fast a ground speed

two reasons for taking off into the wind
shorter ground roll to reach Vr, less wear and tear on the landing gear at lower ground speed

common errors in performance of S-turns
failure to clear the area, poor coordination, gaining or losing altitude, inability to visualize the half-circle ground track, poor timing in beginning and recovery of turns, faulty correction for drift, inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft

things to consider when choosing an area for ground reference maneuvers
obstructions, type of reference (road or point), emergency landing areas, noise-sensitive areas

reasons turning final into a left quatering head/cross wind is dangerous
too late of a turn, pilot tightens turn, applies excessive rudder into the turn, pitches up while turning - all of this could lead to an accelerated stall

describe angle of attack during slow flight
high

effect of abruptly raising flaps during slow flight
sudden loss of lift, causing altitude loss and possibly a stall

considerations when doing the turn-around-a-point maneuver
pick point away from buildings or towers, perform clearing turns, enter maneuver downwind at 800 ft AGL, try to tell examiner when bank angle is steepest, roll out on entry heading

learning steep turns develops
smoothness, coordination, orientation, division of attention, and control techniques for executing maximum performance turns when the airplane is near its performance limits

why ballooning is particular dangerous during crosswind conditions
with lower airspeed, crosswind will affect airplane more, wing will have to be lowered even more

reason tricycle gear airplane bounces when it touches down with an excessively high rate of sink or improper landing attitude
rebounds into the air because the wing's angle of attack is abruptly increased, producing sudden addition to lift

common errors in performance of turn-around-a-point
failure to clear the area, failure to establish proper bank on entry, failure to recognize wind drift, excessive bank on downwind side, inadequate bank angle on upwind side, skidding turns when turning downwind to upwind, slipping turns when turning upwind to downwind, gaining or losing altitude, inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft, inability to direct attention outside the aircraft

slopes of warm vs. cold fronts
warm fronts are characterized by having a gentle slope, promoting layered or stratiform cloudiness and precipitation along and ahead of the front if the warm rising air is stable; cold fronts have a steep slope, and the warm air is forced upward abruptly, often leading to a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms along or just ahead of the front if the warm rising air is unstable
