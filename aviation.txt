how to recover from an inadvertent spin
throttle idle, ailerons neutral, full opposite rudder, neutral elevator, neutralize rudder, gradually apply aft aileron pressure to return to level flight

problems that can be caused by ground effect
floating during landing, illusion that plane can climb during takeoff when it can't if too heavy etc.

what ATC services are provided in class B for VFR pilots?
sequencing and separation

who is responsible for avoiding wake turbulence in class B airspace?
PIC

typical dimensions of class C airspace
5nm core SFC to 4000 ft, 10nm shelf from 1200 ft to 4000 ft above airport elevation, outer radius of 20nm

minimum equipment for class C
radio, mode-C transponder

requirements for departing satellite airport within class C airspace
establish two-way radio communication with ATC as soon as practical after departing

how is class C depicted on the sectional chart?
solid magenta line

ATC services provided within class C
sequencing to primary airport, within airspace and outer area, basic radar outside the outer area on a load-permitting basis

types of terminal radar services for VFR aircraft
basic radar service (safety, alerts, traffic advisories, limited radar vectoring, sequencing), TRSA (radar), class C service (basic radar, separation between IFR and VFR, sequencing of VFR arrivals to primary airport), class B services (similar to class C services)

where is mode C transponder required
>= 10000 ft MSL over 48 contig stats or DC excluding airspace below 2500 AGL, within 30 miles of class B primary airport, within and above all class C airspace up to 10000 ft MSL, within 10 miles of certain designated airports excluding outside class D surface area and below 1200 AGL, ADIZs

maximum airspeed within class C airspace
200 knots <= 2500 ft above surface within 4 nm of primary airport

required eqipment for class D
radio

requirements for departing from satellite airport within class D
must establish two-way radio communication with ATC as soon as practical after departing

is ATC clearance required for VFR flight through class E surface area arrival extension?
no

how is class D depicted?
blue dashed lines

what type of ATC services are provided in class D airspace?
no separation for VFR, controller might provide advisories if workload permits

maximum speed within class D
200 knots <= 2500 above surface within 4 nm of primary airport

what happens when class D control tower is closed?
either: 1) class E surface area rules, or 2) class E rules down to 700 AGL and class G rules to surface.  Consult chart supplements.

will all airports with an operating control tower always have class D airpspace around them?
no, some airports do not have the required weather reporting for surface based controlled airspace

equipment required in class E
none specific

purpose of class E transition area (from 700 ft AGL - magenta, from 1200 ft AGL - blue)
IFR, help separate IFR and VFR traffic

are you required to establish communication with a tower operating within class E?
yes

how are class E surface extensions depicted?
magenta dashed line

are you required to establish communication with a tower located in class G?
yes

vertical limits of class G
surface up to overlying class E, not to exceed 14,500 ft MSL

cloud clearance and visibility requirements for class G at night when in the pattern below 1200 ft AGL
1-3 SM, must be within 1/2 mile from runway

main difference of class G from class A/B/C/D/E?
flight visibility and cloud clearance requirements

basic VFR weather minimums
1000 ft ceiling and 3 mile visibility

how to obtain SVFR clearances 
VFR must be requested to the tower and be granted, workload permitting, and less likely in B and C than D and E due to volume of IFR traffic

examples of SFRAs
DC, Grand Canyon; see chart legend and part 93, check NOTAMs

where to find info on special use airspaces
on chart, https://sua.faa.gov

where to find info on VFR flyways, VFR corridors, and class B transition routes
normally on reverse side of VFR terminal area chart (aka class B airspace chart)

military training routes altitude ranges
<= 1500 ft AGL are VFR (4-digit ids, e.g., VR 1008), > 1500 ft AGL are usually IFR (3-digit ids, eg., IR 003, VR 004)

ADIZ locations
domestic (along U.S. border), coastal, distant early warning identification zone (DEWIZ) over coastal waters of Alaska, land-based ADIZ over U.S. metro areas (activated via NOTAMs)

requirements for operation within an ADIZ
filed flight plan, two-way radio, radar beacon transponder (as opposed to a mode-C), position reports, aircraft position tolerances (+/- 5 minutes), follow land-based NOTAMs

incident
an occurrence associated with an aircraft other than an accident which affects or could affect the safety of operations

accident
an occurrence associated with an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or in which which the aircraft receives substantial damage

serious injuries
requires hospitalization for more than 48 hours commencing within 7 days from date the injury was received, causes fraction of any bone (other than fingers, toes, nose), causes severe hemorrhages or nerve/muscle/tendon damage, involves any internal organs, involves 2nd or 3rd degree burns affecting more than 5% of the body surface

substantial damage
adversely affects the structural strength, performance, or flight characteristics of the aircraft and which would normally require major repair or replacement

damages NOT considered substantial 
limited to only one engine of multiple, bent fairings or cowling, dented skin, small punctured holes in skin, ground damage to rotor or propeller blades, landing gear, wheels, tires, flaps, engine accessories, brakes, wing tips

is immediate notification of accident to NTSB required if no one got hurt?
yes

where are accident/incident reports filed?
local NTSB field office

deadlines for filing an NTSB report
within 10 days after accident, when overdue aircraft is missing after 7 days, upon request for an incident

can FAA use reports submitted to NASA for enforcement purposes?
no, except for accidents and criminal offenses that are wholly excluded from the program

what does rotating beacon during daylight hours indicate for class B/C/D/E-surface?
ground visibility is less than 3 miles and/or the ceiling is less than 1000 ft and that ATC clearance is required for landing, takeoff, and flight in traffic patterns

types of airport signs
mandatory instruction sign (red bg, white fg) for runway entrance, location sign (black bg, yellow fg, yellow border), direction sign (yellow bg, black fg) identifies the designation of the intersecting taxiway(s) leading out of an intersection, destination sign (yellow bg, black fg, arrows) provides info on locating runways/terminals/cargo-areas/civil-aviation-areas, information sign (yellow bg, black fg) provides information for things that can't be seen from the control tower, runway distane remaining sign (black bg, white fg) in thousands of feet

color for runway, taxiway markings
white, yellow
