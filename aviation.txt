false horizon
at night, pilot inadvertently orients the aircraft with a false horizon

linear perspective illusions
when pilot's sight-picture during landing is different from what he/she is used to

precipitation illusions

white-out
when flying over snow-covered terrain there is no obvious distinction between sky and terrain

empty field myopia

confirmation bias
seeing/hearing what you want to see/hear when reality is different

sensory exclusion
when you are overly focused on one of your senses that you ignore the others

Bernoulli's Principle
pressure of fluid decreases at points where speed of the fluid increases

factors that affect both lift and drag
wing area, shape of airfoil, angle of attack, velocity of air, air density

effect of torque reaction (left turning tendency) in flight
makes airplane roll

effect of torque reaction (left turning tendency) on the ground
more weight on left wheel causing more friction and thus turn to left

reason gyro precession effect more pronounced on taildraggers
tail is raised during takeoff

situations that can cause max load factor to be exceeded
>45-deg turns, turbulence, speed above Va

effect of increasing load factor on stall speed
higher stall speed because higher angle of attack during higher load factor

cases operating below Va may not prevent structural damage
multiple full control inputs in one axis or full control inputs in multiple axes at the same time

loss of control in-flight (LOC-I)
significant deviation of aircraft from intended flight path

situations that increase chances of LOC-I
uncoordinated flight, equipment malfunction, pilot complacency, distraction, turbulence, poor risk management

primary cause of spins
exceeding angle of attack while applying incorrect rudder and, to a lesser extent, aileron

when are spins most likely to occur
engine failure on takeoff during climbout, cross-control turn from base to final, engine failure on approach to landing, go-around with full nose-up trim, go-around with improper flap retraction

how to recover from an inadvertent spin
throttle idle, ailerons neutral, full opposite rudder, neutral elevator, neutralize rudder, gradually apply aft aileron pressure to return to level flight

problems that can be caused by ground effect
floating during landing, illusion that plane can climb during takeoff when it can't if too heavy etc.

gross weight
maximum allowable weight of both airplane and contents

useful load includes

effect of weight on takeoff and landing performance
higher liftoff speed, greater mass to accelerate, increasing retarding force, longer takeoff distance

effect of density altitude on takeoff and landing performance
increased takeoff distance, reduced rate of climb, increased true airspeed on approach and landing, increased landing roll distance

air density has a direct effect on
lift, power output of engine, propeller efficiency, drag forces

on sectional chart, blue airport with no airspace boundary markers
controlled class G airport that is in the process of becoming a class D airport, treat it as class D during landings

cause of carburator icing
vaporization of fuel combined with expansion of air causes a sudden cooling of the mixture, water is squeezed out and could freeze

how to know if carburator icing has been eliminated
when heat is first applied, there will be a drop in RPM, then rise, and then engine should run more smoothly

conditions favorable to carburator icing
temperatures below 70F, at least 80% humidity

anti-icing equipment
prevents ice from forming on certain protected surfaces, such as pitot tube and static port, carburator, fuel vents, prop blades, windshields

deicing equipment
removes ice that has already been formed, such as inflatable boots on the wing and tail leading edges

planes with anti-icing and deicing equipment can be flown in icing conditions (yes/no)
not necssarily, consult POH

during runup, you switch to RIGHT magneto and see no RPM drop because...
left P-lead is not grounding OR left magneto has been dead for a while

actions to take if oil pressure is low but oil temperature is normal

how to ensure that TAA enhances situational awareness
callouts, verification checks, verify flight plan entered correctly, verify waypoints, use VOR to back up GPS, stay within personal limitations

operational procedures to avoid CFIT
maintain SA, sterile cockpit, familiarize yourself with surrounding terrain and obstacles, adhere to published routes and minimum altitudes, don't become complacent

most important things to be aware if with AP
know which modes are engaged and armed, ensure proper power to maintain level altitilude
