{sys} power sources for gyros
vacuum, pressure, electric

{sys} how attitude indicator works
rotates in the horizontal plane and operates off of the principle of rigidity in space, aircraft pitches and rolls around the erect gyroscope, effects of precession are not felt because pendulous vanes attached to the base of the gyro duct high pressure air from the vacuum through small doors that open and close by the force of gravity to keep the gyro in its original position

{sys} errors in attitude indicator
may be slight nose up during acceleration, also may be bank/pitch angle error after 180-degree turn

{sys} how the heading indicator works
rotates in the vertical plane and operates off of rigidity in space, as the aircraft yaws around the gyro, a gear inside of the instrument case rotates the compass card to show the magnetic direction, precession caused from aircraft movement and friction causes error that must be corrected by resetting the heading indicator to the magnetic compass approximately every 15 minutes

{sys} errors in heading indicator
precession caused by friction, needs to be checked every 15 min

{sys} how does the vertical speed indicator work
measures the difference between static pressure and static pressure that is subject to a calibrated leak approximately every 6-9 seconds

{sys} gyro rigidity in space
while spinning, a gyroscope will tend to stay fixed in its plane of rotation, like a bicycle wheel, with enough momentum you are able to stay naturally balanced

{sys} gyro precession
when a force is applied to a gyroscope, the resultant force is felt 90° ahead in the direction of the rotation

{sys} how turn coordinator works
electrically powered gyro rotates in the vertical plane and it uses precession to measure rate of turn and rate of roll, when the aircraft yaws, the gyro precesses and the airplane on the face of the instrument indicates the direction and rate of the turn. Notice in the diagram of the instrument that it is slightly canted upwards (this is so rate of roll can be indicated as well), when the aircraft begins a bank the aircraft will also indicate the direction of the bank, if it is a rapid roll the airplane will respond by banking more steeply, once the turn is established it will properly indicate the rate of the turn

{sys} what cools the engine
air intakes at the front of the engine cowling allow outside air to cool the cylinders, fins on the filters allow a greater surface area to be exposed and thus cooled by the air, engine oil is crucial in internal engine cooling

{sys} meaning of four-stroke engine
intake valve opens as downward moving piston pulls fuel/air mixture into cylinder, while this piston is in its upmost position the spark plugs ignite the mixture and force the piston back down, as the piston rises, the exhaust valve opens and expels the exhaust gas from the cylinder

{sys} problems with excessive fuel/air mixture as altitude increases
can result in carbon build up in the cylinders which can foul the spark plugs and reduce engine power

{sys} resulting color if different aviation fuel types are mixed
clear

{sys} what types of aviation fuel are naturally clear
Jet A

{sys} how a vacuum system works
engine driven vacuum pump creates suction, air is pulled through a filter and then directed to the instrument case, rotor vanes on the gyros catch the air like a water wheel and cause it to rotate at a high speed, in some aircraft there is also an electrical vacuum pump to be used as a backup

{weather} cumulus stage of a thunderstorm
the building stage of a thunderstorm characterized by updrafts only, all thunderstorms begin as cumulus clouds but not all cumulus clouds become thunderstorms

{weather} mature stage of a thunderstorm
updrafts and downdrafts both occur at this point, violent turbulence can be experienced if flight is attempted beneath a cumulonimbus cloud because of this shear zone, the mature stage can be recognized by the beginning of rainfall

{weather} dissipating stage of a thunderstorm
at this point the cloud is only giving off downdrafts and the thunderstorm is dissipating, during this stage large cumulonimbus clouds may have a recognizable “anvil top” that is a portion of the cloud that has been sheared off by the jet stream, the direction in which the anvil top is facing also shows the direction in which the storm is moving

{pilot} body systems used to ascertain our orientation and movement in space
vestibular, somatosensory, visual

{pilot} vestibular system
the inner ear system is composed of 3 semicircular hollow but fluid filled canals arranged in the pitch, roll, and yaw axes, this endolymph fluid inside the canals moves when the head or body moves and displaces tiny hair cells that stimulate nerve impulses, these signals are then sent to the brain and interpreted as motion

{pilot} somatosensory system
the nerves in our skin cells, this is basically “flying by the seat of your pants” or the sensations of motion that we feel in our bodies from acceleration or turning

{pilot} visual system
our eyes, light from the sun is constantly being reflected by everything on Earth, this light enters the eyeball through the cornea, travels through the lens and falls on the photoreceptors of the retina, the two kinds of photoreceptors are rods and cones, rods are used for night and peripheral vision, cones are used to sense color

{pilot} cause of middle ear pain in flight
air inside of the middle ear is normally equalized through the Eustachian tube: a tube that travels from the ear to the back of the throat on each side, if there is any kind of congestion or blockage it makes this equalization difficult or impossible, in a climb, the air outside becomes less dense and the trapped higher pressure air in the middle ear tends to expand, in a descent, the trapped air is of lower pressure than the outside air and feeling of compression is experienced, this is typically more painful and more difficult to resolve, sinus congestions cause pain from similar circumstances and can be very painful, 

{pilot,critical} how to mitigate middle ear pain
first step in avoiding this pain is to not fly with head colds or ear/sinus infections, in flight equalization can be helped along by swallowing, yawning, tensing the throat muscles, or by executing the Valsalva maneuver, accomplished by pinching the nostrils, closing the mouth, and attempting to exhale, oral decongestions do not provide adequate relief and may have adverse side effects

{sop} how to determine if another aircraft is at the same altitude
use the horizon as a refernce

{sys} where to find weight and balance for a specific aircraft
usually attached to the Flight Manual or POH

{sop} what to expect if you have to make a no-flaps landing
landing with the flaps up requires about 10 knot faster approach, you can expect to come in "shallower," the landing roll will be longer due to the higher speed and due to the lack of aerodynamic braking effect from the extended flaps

{reg} where to find FAA specified aircraft limitations
POH, attachments to the Airworthiness Certificate, markings on instruments, or instrument panel placards

{pilot} name two things that you can do before the flight (on the ground) to help minimize the chance of a mid-air collision while in the air
clean the windshield, organize the cockpit and information as far as possible

{perf} practical aerodynamic effects of operating with a center of gravity at the forward-most legal position
as the CG position moves toward the forward limit the aircraft becomes more longitudinally stable, the elevator controls will feel heavier, requiring more muscle power to move them, pitch response will also become sluggish increasing the likelihood of accidents such as landing on the nose wheel, a more stable aircraft will be easier to trim for steady flight

{sys} maximum power mixture setting
slightly richer than maximum economy setting, it is approximately +50F to the rich side of EGT

{sys} what to notice when removing the fuel cap
if there is a sudden rush of air when the cap is being cracked open, there could be a serious blockage in the vent system

{sys} the oil pressure gauge changes more quickly than the oil temperature gauge (yes/no)
yes, oil takes more time to heat up or cool down

{sys} what sits between crankshaft and piston
connecting rod

{sys} 172SP fuel system
2 tanks, fuel flows from each wing by gravity to selector valve (which should be one BOTH for takeoff and landing and normally), fuel goes through electrically powered auxilliary fuel pump bypassing the shutoff valve, then flows through the fuel strainer and the engine driven fuel pump into the fuel/air control unit, the fuel/air mixture (ratio governed by mixture control, air governed by throttle) then flows through the fuel distribution valve into the cylinders

{sys} full rich setting
maximum amount of fuel possible is entering the engine, provides cooling and rapid throttle response, could cause roughness at high altitudes

{sys} wet sump vs. dry sump oil system
in wet sump (most common in light aircraft) oil is located in a sump and is an integral part of the engine (pump circulates oil between sump and engine), in dry sump oil is contained in a separate tank and circulated through the engine via pumps (allows for higher volume of oil to be pumped in and out of the engine for very large reciprocating engines)

{sys} what would happen to a reciprocating engine designed for 100LL fuel if Jet A fuel were used
it may start and run, but will fail from detonation

{sys} best way to prevent water from condensing in your aircraft's fuel tanks
completely fill tanks with proper grade after each flight or at least after the last flight of the day

{sys} when permissible to use automotive fuel as a substitute
only if a supplemental type certificate (STC) has been issued to allow its use

{sys} service ceiling for single engine is when can climb at least this many fpm
50

{sys} design maneuvering speed (Va)
the speed below which you can move a single flight control, one time, to its full deflection, for one axis of airplane rotation only (pitch, roll or yaw), in smooth air, without risk of damage to the airplane

{perf} flying from a high pressure area to a low pressure area without adjusting the altimeter while maintaining a constant indicated altitude would result in a
loss of true altitude

{perf} low density air vs. efficiency
increases efficiency because, as the aircraft flies, there are fewer air molecules "in its way" and thus there is less drag created and the aircraft does not have to work as hard to go a given distance

{perf} when an aircraft is flying where it is colder than standard temperature, the altimeter indicates
higher than true altitude

{perf} a pilot flies at a constant indicated altitude from an area of low pressure and high temperature to an area of high pressure and low temperature, which means true altitude will be
indeterminant

{perf} effects of temperature changes on aircraft performance
in hot weather, with high density altitude, the airplane will be more efficient and move through the air faster, but will have reduced performance characteristics (lower climb rate for example)

{perf} reasons you might be restricted to a gross (operational) weight less than the published max gross weight
high density altitude, high-drag or high-friction conditions caused by wet grass or water on the runway

{sop} common errors when practicing power-off accuracy landings
failure to lower landing gear (when applicable), attempting to stretch a glide, premature flap extension, premature landing gear extension, use of throttle to increase glide instead of merely clearing the engine (briefly advancing throttle to normal cruise), forcing airplane onto the runway to avoid overshoot

{sop} stabilized approach
approach in which pilot maintains a constant angle glidepath toward a predetermined point on the runway

{sop} when bank is steepest in S-turns across a road
when beginning the turn on the downwind side of the road

{sop} reason flaps are generally recommended during soft-field landing
aid in touching down at minimum speed

{sop} reason why one would not want to use flaps during a soft-field landing
in low-wing airplanes, the flaps may suffer damage from mud, stones, or slush being thrown up by the wheels

{sop} three phases of a spin 
incipient spin, fully-developed spin, spin recovery

{sop} two dangers of operating an engine in-flight at idle speed for a prolonged time, recommended action
excessive engine cooling and spark plug fouling, clear the engine by briefly advancing the throttle to normal cruise power

{sop} action pilot should take if strong ballooing occurs upon landing
execute an immediate go-around before the plane stalls

{sop} accelerated stall
any stall that occurs higher than the expected Vso

{sop} causes of accelerated stalls
airplane is heavier than max gross weight, airplane is flying uncoordinated, less flaps out than published with Vso, atmosphere less dense than published for Vso, load factor greater than speed for which the speed was published

{sop} what to do if you encounter unexpected traffic in the middle of steep turns
immediately stop doing the maneuver and ensure safe separation from the traffic (duh!)

{sop} special considerations for planning an approach and landing in turbulent conditions
fly slightly faster than normal speeds (e.g., +5 kts)

{perf} why aircraft don't always stall when you are below the bottom of the white arc
below max gross weight, air is more dense

{sop} common errors while performing power-off and power-on stalls
failure to clear the area, inability to recognize stall using feel, premature recovery, over-reliance on airspeed indicator, inadequate scanning resulting in wing-low condition, excessive back-elevator pressure, inadequate rudder control, secondary stall during recovery, failure to maintain constant bank angle during turning stalls, excessive forward-elevator pressure during recovery resulting in negative load on wings, excessive airspeed buildup during recovery, failure to take timely action to prevent a full stall during the conduct of imminent stalls

{sop} common errors while perfoming slow flight
failure to clear the area, inadequate back-elevator pressure resulting in altitude loss, excessive back-elevator pressure resulting in climb, inadequate compensation for adverse yaw during turns, fixation on airspeed indicator, failure to anticipate changes in lift as flaps are extended, inadequate power management, inability to divide time between aircraft control and orientation

{sop} secondary stall occurs when
there is incomplete recovery from an initial stall, such as not lowering the nose enough

{sop} action pilot should take if slight ballooning occurs during landing
maintain attitude, possibly add a little throttle to help cushion the landing

{perf} speed instability as it pertains the slow flight
airspeed will decrease if the airplane is disturbed by even the slightest turbulence, drag will then increase resulting in further loss of speed, and this decay will continue until the aircraft stalls

{sop} action if speed instability occurs due to turbulence
increase power

{sop} common errors during a go-around
failure to recognize the need to do a go-around, indecision, delay, failure to apply max power in a timely manner, abrupt power application, improper pitch attitude, failure to reconfigure the aircraft (e.g., for takeoff trim, flaps), attempting to climb out of ground effect prematurely, failure to apply right rudder to compensate for torque/p-factor

{sop} corrective action if airplane bounces back into the air upon landing
same as for ballooning, depends on severity (go-around or slight increase in power)

{sop} problem with touching down while in a crab or drift
extreme sideways load on landing gear, increasing chances of structural failure

{sop} steps to recover from a spiral dive

apply more aileron pressure toward the high wing

{reg} minimum slow flight climb allowed by regulations

{sop} common errors in the performance of steep turns
failure to clear the area, excessive pitch during entry or recovery, attempts to start recovery prematurely, failure to stop the turn on proper heading, excessive rudder during recovery resulting in skidding, inadequate power management, inadequate airspeed control, poor coordination, losing altitude in left turns, gaining altitude in right turns, failure to maintain constant bank angle, disorientation, attempting to perform the maneuver by instrument reference rather than visual reference, failure to scan for other traffic during the maneuver

{sop} where to turn more than 90 degrees on a rectangular course
crosswind to downwind, downwind to base

{sop} where to turn less than 90 degrees on a rectangular course
base to upwind (final), upwind to crosswind

{sop} how to estimate wind direction and speed while performing a power-off emergency landing
look at windsock

{sop} common errors in the performance of crosswind landings
crosswinds that exceed the maximum demonstrated crosswind component reported in the POH, inadequate compensation for wind drift when turning base to final, inadequate compensation for wind drift when on final approach, unstabilized approach, failure to compensate for increased drag during side slip resulting in faster descent, touchdown while drifting, touchdown while crabbed, excessive airspeed on touchdown, failure to apply appropriate control inputs during rollout, failure to maintain direction control on rollout, excessive braking

{sop} wheelbarrowing
condition that occurs when pilot allows airplane weight to become concentrated about the nosewheel, resulting in less control with main wheels particularly during crosswind conditions

{sop} main cause of wheelbarrowing
simultaneous touchdown of main wheels and nose wheel, with excessive speed, followed by forward pressure on the elevator control

{perf} when is ground effect most significant
when airplane (especially low-wing) is maintaining constant attitude at low airspeed during takeoff/landing

{sop} most likely negative outcome when pilot tries to control porpoising by controlling pitch and power to try to land
they won't be able to time them with the oscillations and will only make the situation worse

{sop} why braking should be avoided during soft-field landings
may cause the nosewheel to dig in

{sop} common errors in performance of short-field landings
misjudgement of wind, incorrect speed, unstabilized approach, poor roundout to flare, insufficient flaps, power management, failure to idle the engine, hard touchdown, inadequate transfer of weight to main wheels during touchdown, too much application of brakes at too fast a ground speed

{sop} two reasons for taking off into the wind
shorter ground roll to reach Vr, less wear and tear on the landing gear at lower ground speed

{sop} common errors in performance of S-turns
failure to clear the area, poor coordination, gaining or losing altitude, inability to visualize the half-circle ground track, poor timing in beginning and recovery of turns, faulty correction for drift, inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft

{sop} things to consider when choosing an area for ground reference maneuvers
obstructions, type of reference (road or point), emergency landing areas, noise-sensitive areas

{sop} reasons turning final into a left quatering head/cross wind is dangerous
too late of a turn, pilot tightens turn, applies excessive rudder into the turn, pitches up while turning - all of this could lead to an accelerated stall

{perf} describe angle of attack during slow flight
high

{perf} effect of abruptly raising flaps during slow flight
sudden loss of lift, causing altitude loss and possibly a stall

{sop} considerations when doing the turn-around-a-point maneuver
pick point away from buildings or towers, perform clearing turns, enter maneuver downwind at 800 ft AGL, try to tell examiner when bank angle is steepest, roll out on entry heading

{sop} learning steep turns develops
smoothness, coordination, orientation, division of attention, and control techniques for executing maximum performance turns when the airplane is near its performance limits

{sop} why ballooning is particular dangerous during crosswind conditions
with lower airspeed, crosswind will affect airplane more, wing will have to be lowered even more

{sop} reason tricycle gear airplane bounces when it touches down with an excessively high rate of sink or improper landing attitude
rebounds into the air because the wing's angle of attack is abruptly increased, producing sudden addition to lift

{sop} common errors in performance of turn-around-a-point
failure to clear the area, failure to establish proper bank on entry, failure to recognize wind drift, excessive bank on downwind side, inadequate bank angle on upwind side, skidding turns when turning downwind to upwind, slipping turns when turning upwind to downwind, gaining or losing altitude, inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft, inability to direct attention outside the aircraft

{chart} practical airspace you need to know for checkride
which airspace and clearance requirements you have along each point of your XC flight

{sop} practical info needed for night flying for checkride
how to determine lighting at an airport, aero medical factors affecting night flight

{sop} common checkride mistake regarding navigation
most can plot the course on a chart, calculate a heading and time and then won't actually fly it; some meander all over hoping it's somewhere in front of them.

{sop} common checkride mistake for emergency landing
not establishing best glide airspeed; not selecting a suitable landing area; many applicants fail to utilize pitch trim to assist in maintaining this speed and reduce their workload; when choosing a suitable landing site, a common error is disregarding hazards such as power lines or a tree line in the way; every effort should be made to land into the wind; always be aware of the surface winds below you; by landing into the wind, our groundspeed will be greatly reduced increasing our chances for a successful outcome; most people end up way too high on the final approach; they also try to impress me by reading the checklist; I would rather see you do the things needed, worry about a checklist when you have time. remember you are single-pilot; don't forget we will go-around at no less than 500 feet AGL if there isn't a runway in front of us.

{sop} common checkride mistakes with short-field landings 
you calculated the distance over the obstacle; I usually use the end of the runway for the placement of the 50ft obstacle, that usually keeps us on the VASI; tou are expected to land in the distance that you calculated; you will need to know how to use the brakes properly; if you cross the threshold below 50ft after I said there is an obstacle at the end, you just demonstrated you can't judge height, most VASI's are adjusted for 50ft; many applicants begin with a close in turn to base resulting in being high on final or a shorter final segment allowing little time to get the aircraft configured and stable; the most common outcome that is unsatisfactory is overshooting the intended touchdown spot; this overshoot is usually a result of excessive speed or trying to make a soft landing with a last second flare causing the aircraft to float beyond the allowed distance (within 200’); volatile approach which results in oscillation between level-off and descent; excess deceleration on rollout which can lock up the wheels; planting the nosewheel down hard, rather than controlling its descent; forgetting to apply brakes after all 3 wheels touch down

{sop} common checkride mistake with being a PIC
above all the applicant must NEVER decide to do the flight portion in conditions or situations that is beyond his personal limits

{sop} common checkride mistake with short-field takeoff
not using MAXIMUM available runway; lifting off too quickly, not adding sufficient exhaust back pressure to control the Vx; dropping while transitioning from Vx to Vy

{sop} common checkride mistakes with stall recovery
not looking outside to determine pitch attitude, pushing the stick briskly forward to break the stall then adding full power (too much altitude loss)

{sop} how to properly break a power-off stall
relax back pressure until the stall horn is gone or there is no buffeting and only that far, add full power as you are doing this, use rudder to keep a wing from dropping, reduce the flap to approach setting while maintaining an attitude that is un-stalled, allow the airplane to accelerate to Vy then retract the remaining flap; the objective of stall recovery is a minimum altitude loss during recovery

{sop} common checkride mistake with traffic pattern procedures
after completing the required air work (or maneuvers), the applicant has to return to the airport of departure or in some cases a nearby airport to complete the takeoff and landings; many times, the pilot loses situational awareness while returning, and most commonly enters the pattern for the wrong runway

{reg} private pilot minimum practical experience in hours
dual: 20 hours (3 night with 100 XC and 10 full stops, 3 XC day, 3 reference maneuvers, 3 instrument, 3 practice within 2 months of checkride); solo: 10 hours (5 total XC > 50nm, one 150 nm with full stop 3 points, 3 controlled takeoffs/landings); total: 40

{sop} ways to reduce altitude during emergency landings
full flaps, S-turns, slips

{sop} common mistakes during power-on stall recovery
too much right rudder going into the stall, using ailerons, not letting nose come down before applying opposite rudder, too much opposite rudder 

{sop} common mistakes trying to navigate to a VOR
not toggling radio freq selector, not listening on nav1 (switch not on), not having nav volume up, not verifying Morse code audibly or using radio nav database confirmation, not centering the needle

{sop} common mistakes during soft-field landings
too steep of a descent; not applying a little power toward the end to stay in ground effect longer; not holding the nose up after touch-down; applying any brakes

{chart} only time it makes sense to request SVFR
when you know the weather is significantly better away from the airport; only consider it when you are flying from or to an area of excellent weather; even then, it's a bad idea

{chart} what to do if you are flying SVFR and visibility drops below 1 mile
get an IFR clearance if you are IFR rated in an IFR aircraft, otherwise you must declare an emergency

{chart} rationale for class E 5-1-1-1SM >= 10000 ft MSL
give VFR aircraft more time to react to fast planes popping in and out of the clouds

{sop} how to know min height AGL at which you can do impossible turn
once you determine how much altitude your particular aircraft loses during a 180-degree turn, increase this figure by at least 50 percent to determine the minimum turnaround altitude

{sop} when ATC says "cleared for the option"
means you can land, do a stop and go, do a touch and go, or low approach
