rotations of high vs. low pressure systems

how VOR works
VOR station transmits two radio signals, a stationary reference signal, and a rotating variable signal that is out of phase by the radial angle

LDA approach
like a LOC approach, but localizer is 3-5 degrees offset from the runway centerline; requires circle-to-land if offset exceeds 30 degrees

LDA/GS approach 
provides both lateral and vertical guidance, but the final approach course is not aligned with the runway due to terrain or obstacle limitations

clear ice forms
when large, supercooled water droplets strike surface and freeze slowly; most common in cumuliform clouds or freezing rain, between 0C and -10C; hard to remove and heavy

rime ice forms
when small, supercooled water droplets freeze rapidly upon contact with the surface, trapping air bubbles; most common in stratiform clouds or light drizzle, between -10C and -20C; easier to remove and lighter and more brittle

mixed ice
combination of clear and rime

radiation fog forms when
earth loses its heat at night in the form of infrared radiation because the ground is no longer receiving sunlight; as the ground cools, the temperature of warm, moist, stationary air above it cools to the dew point; can form at daybreak

static pressure altimeter works by
comparing ambient pressure outside the aircraft through static port to the pressure inside a sealed diaphram which has a reference pressure of 29.92

airspeed indicator works by
comparing total pressure inside the Pitot tube with the ambient pressure from the static port

precession occurs with gyroscopic instruments when
a force is applied to the spinning rotor; instead of responding directly at the point of force, the gyroscope reacts 90 degrees later in the direction of rotation

steam-gauge heading indicator works by
having a vacuum pump draw air through it, spinning an internal gyroscope at high speed, which remains rigid in space due to its rotational inertia; as aircraft turns, the instrument case and compass card rotate around the stable gyroscope; the gyroscope can drift over time due to precession

preferred location of AHRS magnetometer
wingtip, as it is far from sources of magnetic disturbance

significance of a low-pressure trough on a weather map
troughs are often associated with rising air, which can lead to cloud formation, precipitation, turbulence, and wind shifts; if the air is unstable and moist, the trough can act as a trigger for convective activity

a low-pressure trough may not matter when
the air is dry and stable

air rises at a low-pressure trough because
surface winds tend to converge along the axis of lower pressure; they have nowhere to go but up; often times, troughs occur with different air masses meet, so warm, moist air will get pushed upward by cool, dry air

REIL
runway lighting that uses a pair of synchronized flashing lights, one on each side of the threshold

MALSR
set of sequenced lights installed along the extended runway centerline to lead pilot to the threshold

3 types of runway entrance lights at large airports
1) Runway Entrance Lights (REL) are lights along the taxiway centerline that illuminate red when an aircraft is on final approach or on the runway; 2) Takeoff Hold Lights (THL) are a double row of lights on either side of the runway centerline that illuminate red when it would e unsafe to takeoff due to the runway being occupied by an aircraft or ground vehicle; 3) Runway Intersection Lights (TIL) are a double row of lights on either side of runway centerline at runway intersections that illuminate red when it is unsafe to cross the intersecting runway

a pilot may descend from a DA or MDA when
1) a landing can be made with a normal rate of descent and normal maneuvers; 2) visibility is not less than the minimum specified for the instrument approach procedure; 3) runway or runway lights or approach lights are distinctly visible; Note: If only the approach lights are visible, the aircraft may descend to 100 feet AGL, and further descent requires that the red side row bars, or red terminating bars, or runway lights, or runway be visible.

cases where a report must be submitted to the NTSB within 10 days
1) An accident involving substantial damage to the aircraft, or significant injury or death to an occupant; 2) Overdue aircraft believed to be involved in an accident; 3) Inability of a flight crew member to perform duties due to injury or illness; 4) Flight control system malfunction or failure; 5) In-flight fire; 6) In-flight aircraft collision

skidding turn is more dangerous that a slipping turn because
skidding turn has higher risk of spin because the inside (low) wing can stall first, causing the aircraft to roll and enter a spin; with a slipping turn, the outside (high) wing is more likely to stall first, often returning the aircraft to coordinated flight

IFR flight requires the following additional instruments over those for VFR: 
attitude indicator, heading indicator, turn coordinator, clock

number of hours that a certified simulator can be used for instrument training
BATD: 10 hours; AATD: 20 hours; and an instructor is no longer required to be present

approaches with different minimums, not necessarily using different navigation systems

PTAC acronym for ATC approach clearances
Position: your position relative to a fix or approach segment; Turn: heading you should fly next; Altitude: altitude to maintain until established; Clearance: actual approach clearance

characteristics of a low-pressure air mass
less dense, rising, less compressed, cooler, lower more vertically developed clouds

the FAA and ICAO define a precision approach as one that is based on 
ground-based navigation aids providing a localizer and a glide slope; LPV is not ground-based, thus GPS approaches are all non-precision

in the context of IFR flight, resume own navigation means
to following radar vectors from ATC and to instead proceed along the previously-cleared route

Coriolis force causes winds

how to substitude GPS for DME

Special VFR 
uncommonly used clearance which allows a VFR flight to enter or depart controlled airspace surrounding an airport when the weather is IFR; the weather must be at least one statue mile in visibility and the pilot must be able to stay clear of clouds; at night, the pilot must be instrument rated and aircraft must be IFR-certified

LNAV/VNAV limitations
does not get more precise as one gets closer to the runway; baro-VNAV is inherently less accirate than ILS or WAAS;

is a WAAS-capable receiver sufficient
yes, if properly certified, and thus may be used at an alternate airport; a VOR receiver is required only for a non-WAAS GPS

core feature of RNAV
can navigate along arbitrary paths through within a wide area with automatic frequency switching among multiple navaids

lost communications procedures when going missed
go to alternate, do not have to hold

if the main radios die and a portable radio can replace them
it may be used because this is an emergency

notify ATC and have them help you climb above the airport before departing the area
