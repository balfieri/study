snowflake on approach plate means
refer to cold temperatures document to make altitude adjustments; when super cold, altitude can read higher than we actually are due to high density of the air

approaches that require WAAS
LPV, LP; WAAS can also be used for LNAV/NVAV

localizer and glideslope, marker beacons or DME, approach lighting

does not line you up with the runway, at least 30 degrees off

embedded thunderstorms are dangerous because
can't see them as you are going through the surrounding clouds

rotations of high vs. low pressure systems
high rotate clockwise; low rotate counterclockwise

how VOR works
VOR station transmits two radio signals, a stationary reference signal, and a rotating variable signal that is out of phase by the radial

LDA approach
like a LOC approach, but localizer is 3-5 degrees offset from the runway centerline; requires circle-to-land if offset exceeds 30 degrees

LDA/GS approach 
provides both lateral and vertical guidance, but the final approach course is not aligned with the runway due to terrain or obstacle limitations; non-precision approach

clear ice forms
when large, supercooled water droplets strike surface and freeze slowly; most common in cumuliform clouds or freezing rain, between 0C and -10C; hard to remove and heavy

rime ice forms
when smalle, supercooled water droplets freeze rapidly upon contact with the surface, trapping air bubbles; most common in stratiform clouds or light drizzle, between -10C and -20C; easier to remove and lighter and more brittle

mixed ice
combination of clear and rime

radiation fog forms when
earth loses its heat at night in the form of infrared radiation because the ground is no longer receiving sunlight; as the ground cools, the temperature of warm, moist, stationary air above it cools to the dew point

static pressure altimeter works by
comparing ambient pressure outside the aircraft through static port to the pressure inside a sealed diaphram which has a reference pressure of 29.92

airspeed indicator works by
comparing total pressure inside the Pitot tube with the ambient pressure from the static port

precession occurs with gyro instruments when
a force is applied to the spinning rotor; instead of responding directly at the point of force, the gyro reacts 90 degrees later in the direction of rotation

steam-gauge heading indicator works by
having a vacuum pump draw air through it, spinning an internal gyroscope at high speed, which remains rigid in space due to its rotational inertia; as aircraft turns, the instrument case and compass card rotate around the stable gyroscope; the gyroscope can drift over time due to precession

preferred location of AHRS magnetometer
wingtip, as it is far from sources of magnetic disturbance

significance of a low-pressure trough on a weather map
troughs are often associated with rising air, which can lead to cloud formation, precipitation, turbulence, and wind shifts; if the air is unstable and moist, the trough can act as a trigger for convective activity

a low-pressure trough may not matter when
the air is dry and stable

air rises at a low-pressure trough because
surface winds tend to converge along the axis of lower pressure; they have nowhere to go but up; often times, troughs occur with different air masses meet, so warm, moist air will get pushed upward by cool, dry air

expected response when ATC issues an IFR clearance to pilot of airborne aircraft
read back those parts containing altitude assignments or vectors, and any part requiring verification

lightning bolt on ILS chart denotes
final approach fix for the precision approach, and also the glideslope intercept altitude

a precision runway monitor (PRM) approach may require
simultaneously monitoring two frequencies (e.g., two tower frequencies)

CAS
IAS corrected for instrument error, position errors, and installation error

baro-VNAV approach uses
altimeter to determine vertical guidance rather than satellites or ground-based systems

baro-VNAV approaches are not authorized
in areas of hazardous terrain or when a remote altimeter setting is required

REIL
runway lighting that uses a pair of synchronized flashing lights, one on each side of the threashold

MALSR
fancy set of lights installed along the extended runway centerline

skidding turn is due to
more centrifugal force than the horizontal lift component

slipping turn is due to
less centrifugal force than the horizontal lift component

how to determine if GPS installed is approved for IFR enroute and approaches
consult flight manual supplement

during IFR enroute and terminal operations with an approved GPS, ground based facilities
must be operational along the entire route of flight; exception: WAAS-capable GPS

if you suspect hyperventilation
consciously breathe at a slower rate than normal; do not need to take deep breaths
