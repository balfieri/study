snowflake on approach plate means
refer to cold temperatures document to make altitude adjustments; when super cold, altitude can read higher than we actually are due to high density of the air

width of ILS glide slope signal
1.4 degrees; range of 10 nautical miles

false glide slope issue with ILS
lobes of glide slope reflect off the ground and end up way higher, which cause the navigation system to get confused if the aircraft is too high

VOR approach with a letter rather than a runway
does not line you up with the runway, at least 30 degrees off

embedded thunderstorms are dangerous because
can't see them as you are going through the surrounding clouds

rotations of high vs. low pressure systems
high rotate clockwise; low rotate counterclockwise

how VOR works
VOR station transmits two radio signals, a stationary reference signal, and a rotating variable signal that is out of phase by the radial angle

LDA approach
like a LOC approach, but localizer is 3-5 degrees offset from the runway centerline; requires circle-to-land if offset exceeds 30 degrees

LDA/GS approach 
provides both lateral and vertical guidance, but the final approach course is not aligned with the runway due to terrain or obstacle limitations

clear ice forms
when large, supercooled water droplets strike surface and freeze slowly; most common in cumuliform clouds or freezing rain, between 0C and -10C; hard to remove and heavy

rime ice forms
when small, supercooled water droplets freeze rapidly upon contact with the surface, trapping air bubbles; most common in stratiform clouds or light drizzle, between -10C and -20C; easier to remove and lighter and more brittle

mixed ice
combination of clear and rime

radiation fog forms when
earth loses its heat at night in the form of infrared radiation because the ground is no longer receiving sunlight; as the ground cools, the temperature of warm, moist, stationary air above it cools to the dew point; can form at daybreak

static pressure altimeter works by
comparing ambient pressure outside the aircraft through static port to the pressure inside a sealed diaphram which has a reference pressure of 29.92

airspeed indicator works by
comparing total pressure inside the Pitot tube with the ambient pressure from the static port

precession occurs with gyroscopic instruments when
a force is applied to the spinning rotor; instead of responding directly at the point of force, the gyroscope reacts 90 degrees later in the direction of rotation

steam-gauge heading indicator works by
having a vacuum pump draw air through it, spinning an internal gyroscope at high speed, which remains rigid in space due to its rotational inertia; as aircraft turns, the instrument case and compass card rotate around the stable gyroscope; the gyroscope can drift over time due to precession

preferred location of AHRS magnetometer
wingtip, as it is far from sources of magnetic disturbance

significance of a low-pressure trough on a weather map
troughs are often associated with rising air, which can lead to cloud formation, precipitation, turbulence, and wind shifts; if the air is unstable and moist, the trough can act as a trigger for convective activity

a low-pressure trough may not matter when
the air is dry and stable

air rises at a low-pressure trough because
surface winds tend to converge along the axis of lower pressure; they have nowhere to go but up; often times, troughs occur with different air masses meet, so warm, moist air will get pushed upward by cool, dry air

read back those parts containing altitude assignments or vectors, and any part requiring verification

lightning bolt on ILS chart denotes
final approach fix for the precision approach, and also the glide slope intercept altitude

REIL
runway lighting that uses a pair of synchronized flashing lights, one on each side of the threshold

MALSR
set of sequenced lights installed along the extended runway centerline to lead pilot to the threshold

characteristics of a high-pressure air mass
denser, sinking, more compressed, warmer, higher clouds

characteristics of a low-pressure air mass
less dense, rising, less compressed, cooler, lower more vertically developed clouds

the FAA and ICAO define a precision approach as one that is based on 
ground-based navigation aids providing a localizer and a glide slope; LPV is not ground-based, thus GPS approaches are all non-precision

in the context of IFR flight, resume own navigation means
to following radar vectors from ATC and to instead proceed along the previously-cleared route

Coriolis force causes winds
to bend toward the right in the Northern hemisphere, which makes them run parallel to isobars rather than perpindicular if only the pressure gradient force existed; this curving shapes large-scale wind patterns, creating westerly winds in mid-latitudes and causing clockwise circulation around highs and counterclockwise around lows in the Northern Hemisphere

at what point do we change course to avoid traffic when on IFR
should first ask advice from ATC, but can do so once you have visual contact

what should be checked before taxiing to runway with an assigned SID
that the aircraft can climb to the assigned altitude at the required climb gradient; for 172 and PA-28, can assume 500 feet per minute initial climb rate, so only check the performance charts if the SID requires more

what to do when engine out in IMC
look at glide range on ForeFlight; switch to VFR chart; work with ATC to choose a location, such as an airport or road

meaning of askterisk in S-ILS 35*
the DA requires a higher missed approach climb gradient

once established on a transition the pilot may
descend according to the published altitudes on the approach

only times do not have to report a vacated altitude
within an assigned block altitude range, during an emergency, or responding to a traffic alert for collision avoidance

if you land at an uncontrolled airport on an IFR flight plan
you must call back ATC or FSS to cancel it; ForeFlight cannot be used to cancel an active flight plan

when to check that GPS level has been achieved
when identifying navaids; first fix on initial fix on final approach segment; check during before-landing checklist

when may electronic devices be used during IFR flights
when non-commercial and the pilot in command has determined that the device will not interfere with the flight

Special VFR 
uncommonly used clearance which allows a VFR flight to enter or depart controlled airspace surrounding an airport when the weather is IFR; the weather must be at least one statue mile in visibility and the pilot must be able to stay clear of clouds; at night, the pilot must be instrument rated and aircraft must be IFR-certified

LNAV/VNAV limitations
does not get more precise as one gets closer to the runway; baro-VNAV is inherently less accirate than ILS or WAAS;

is a WAAS-capable receiver sufficient
yes, if properly certified, and thus may be used at an alternate airport; a VOR receiver is required only for a non-WAAS GPS

core feature of RNAV
can navigate along arbitrary paths through within a wide area with automatic frequency switching among multiple navaids

lost communications procedures when going missed
go to alternate, do not have to hold

if the main radios die and a portable radio can replace them

A-M-E: during an IFR lost communications situation, the altitude you should fly is
the highest of the following three altitudes: the last assigned altitude by ATC, the Minimum IFR altitude for the route segment, or the altitude ATC expected you to fly

meaning of letter A in parentheses on an IFR low enroute chart
ATIS frequency

if pitot ram air source and drain hole are both blocked
indicated airspeed increases with altitude gain, decreases with altitude loss; altimeter and VSI are unaffected

if pitot ram air source is blocked and drain hold is not blocked
indicated airspeed displays zero knots; altimeter and VSI are unaffected

if only the pitot tube drain hole is plugged
indicated airspeed will work fine unless the pitot tube fills up with water

if static source is blocked
indicated airspeed decreases with altitude gain, increases with altitude loss; altimeter does not change with altitude change; VSI does not change with vertical speed change

if both pitot sources and static sources are blocked
indicated airspeed, altimeter, and VSI all remain constant, regardless of changes in airspeed, altitude, and vertical speed

why V-a decreases as weight decreases
lower weight means lower angle of attack, which means could exceed limit load factor on fixed-weight components like engine brackets, which is typically around 3.8 G's for small aircraft; for every 2% reduction in weight, decrease V-a by 1%

L/VNAV
other name for LNAV/VNAV

ATC required to do an IAP if in VMC and pilot requests it
yes, because the pilot can refuse the visual approach

ideal speed when accidentally flying through thunderstorm (such as embedded)

disorientation is still a major cause of accidents among IFR pilots; what can a pilot do when disoriented
level wings, talk to ATC

when must a pilot abide by the VDP
never, it is advisory; however it is highly recommended that a pilot not descend until reaching the VDP and to go missed if the runway environment is not visible at the VDP; the VDP provides a 3-degree slope

when must a pilot abide by the VDA (visual descent angle)
never, it is advisory only

when deciding whether to land, how relevant are the ceilings reported by the AWOS/ATIS
ceilings are irrelevant to the landing decision, except for part 135 which must have sufficient ceilings before proceeding past the final approach fix

if you go missed very early for some reason
you must fly to the missed approach waypoint or beginning of runway before making any turns; the missed approach waypoint is a flyover waypoint; however, you can talk to ATC and see if they will let you break off early

if you break out of the clouds a little above pattern altitude, is it wise to cancel IFR
no because you may need to go missed and could end up in IMC, in which case it is illegal to not have an IFR clearance

the sky is clear and visibility is 2 statute miles, do you need to file an IFR flight plan
yes, because visibility is less than 3 statute miles

if the destination airport has no weather reporting today, may you still fly a published instrument procedure
no, but you could fly IFR to the vicinity then cancel IFR and finish the flight as VFR; further, if you notice this during planning, you must file an alternate because the airport essentially has no IAPs today

visual glide slope indicator
PAPI or VASI

MAA-8000 on an IFR chart stands for 
Maximum Authorized Altitude of 8,000 feet on that route or airway segment, which is the highest altitude at which you are assured reliable navigation signal reception along that airway

SIDs exist in order to
ensure obstacle clearance, improve traffic flow, reduce communication workload, and maintain orderly separation of departing aircraft

if heading to alternate with lost comms
just head to alternate after getting over destination runway and at a safe altitude; do not execute missed procedure; go direct to alternate unless alternate route filed

cleared for the option procedure will permit 
an instructor, flight examiner, or pilot the option to make a touch-and-go, low approach, missed approach, stop-and-go, or full-stop landing

the MDA of 530 feet for a straight-in landing always represents 
height above touchdown (HAT) since the approach is for a specific runway

MDAs for circling approaches will always represent 
height above airport (HAA) since a specific runway will not be used for landing

when does registration expire
7 years from month of registration, change of ownership, death, revocation of USA citizenship

preferred IFR route

if you can't land where missed climb gradient is higher than the aircraft can achieve
tell ATC and work out an ascent over the airport until at a safe altitude

if main radios die, using a portable radio
is allowed, but you should notify ATC of the situation

is a VOR or ILS receiver required if doing an RNAV GPS approach?
no, assuming GPS is IFR-approved and only doing a GPS-based approach; the exception is when flying a GPS approach at an alternate airport when the GPS system is non-WAAS

Visual Climb Over Airport (VCOA)
IFR departure procedure that allows a pilot to climb visually in specified VMC conditions by circling over the airport to a published altitude prior to proceeding en route

lost comms AVEF MEA acronym
A - assigned, V - vectored, E - expected, F - filed; M - miminum IFR altitude for operations for the segment (MEA, MOCA, OROCA), E - expected, A - assigned; so AVEF is for the route and MEA is for the altitude

DVFR flight plan
special VFR flight plan required while penetrating or flying within an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), such as crossing into U.S. airspace from abroad or near certain sensitive boundaries

directions along an en route chart are in terms of
magnetic north

to remain current for daytime flight under VFR, in order to fly passengers, the private pilot must
within the preceding 90 days, have performed at least 3 takeoffs and landings as the sole manipulator of the flight controls in an aircraft of the same category, class, and (if a type rating is required) type that you intend to operate; need to be to a full stop unless you are flying a tailwheel airplane

to remain current for nighttime flight under VFR, in order to fly passengers, the private pilot must
do the same as for daytime currency, except the 3 landings must occur between one hour after sunset to one hour before sunrise, and to a full stop

easiest way to file an IFR flight plan in the air when you unexpectedly encounter IMC
contact ATC and ask for a pop-up clearance; note that this adds a lot of work for them, so consider getting back on the ground and doing it there

if you are on a straight-in IFR approach and notice VFR traffic is about to cut in front of you
you may do a normal traffic pattern entry without contacting ATC; you need only re-contact ATC if you go missed in IMC

conditions under which an alternate airport without an IAP may be used
forecast at ETA must allow a descent from the MEA and landing under basic VFR conditions

when an ILS plate says that RNAV 1-GPS is required, this means that
the GPS must have sensitivity of 1 mile laterally for entry in terminal mode, and that a TAA is present; it might also say OR RADAR in which cases radar vectors may be used for entry

when an ILS plate says that DME is required for LOC
you may always use GPS in lieu of DME

if radio communications are lost during IFR flight and arrival at the clearance limit occurs before the estimated time of arrival (ETA), the initial step is to 
proceed to the fix from which an instrument approach begins (usually the initial approach fix), hold there, and time the commencement of the approach so as to arrive at the destination as close as possible to the ETA specified in the flight plan

Terminal Arrival Area (TAA) on an approach plate
provides a standardized way to transition from the en route phase to the terminal environment for aircraft using RNAV/GPS; it minimizes radio calls ith ATC and ensures obstacle clearance of 1000 feet within a 25 nautical mile radius; a TAA may include NoPT sectors; TAA may be present on some ILS plates when RNAV is required for navigation to the initial fix; pilots may descend to the published sector altitude only if they have been cleared for the approach and only if they have not been assigned a specific vectoring altitude

After ATC clears an aircraft for a visual approach to an untowered airport and hands it off to the CTAF frequency
the pilot remains on an IFR flight plan but is now responsible for visually navigating to the runway and maintaining separation from other aircraft while self-announcing on CTAF; the expectation is that the missed approach will either result in a second pattern circuit for landing, or the pilot will climb, remain VMC, and request instructions from ATC

In order to be assigned a visual approach
the pilot must have visual contact with the airport

In order to fly a SID
the pilot must have a textual description and ATC clearance

When a pilot is within 1000 feet of the desired altitude
the pilot should fly between 500 and 1500 feet per minute to the desired altitude; before that, the pilot should fly at the optimal climb rate for the aircraft

If you lose your attitude indicator or HSI, is that an emergency situation?
Yes, and you should report it to ATC; losing the navigation system is an even larger emergency

Does a pilot need to report entering or leaving a hold in lieu of procedure turn or other such course reversal
no, unless ATC specifically requests it

When doing a circling approach to an MDA, can you still use an LPV glide path to get down to that circling MDA
yes

It is useful to put in the initial approach fix in a filed flight plan because
1) it allows activating the approach sooner; 2) if you lose radio communications, ATC will know where you are heading

If you mistakenly enter into a thunderstorm
disable autopilot, keep the wings level, don't worry about maintaining altitude, then start to make a shallow 180-degree turn back where you came from

What to check during preflight for the presence of supercooled water droplets that could turn into structural ice

types of parallel runway operations
independent parallel approaches, dependent parallel approaches (staggering diagonal approaches), precision runway monitor (PRM, closely spaced runway less than 4300 feet apart, special training required)

difference between a visual approach and a contact approach
a visual approach requires the pilot to have the airport or preceding aircraft in sight, while a contact approach allows proceeding visually with reference to the ground and landmarks, even if the airport is not in sight, provided the pilot can remain clear of clouds with at least one statute mile visibility

around a low-pressure center, where do we normally find cold and warm fronts
air flows inward and upward around a low-pressure system; a cold front usually extends southward or southwestward, while a warm front projects eastward or northeastward

around a high-pressure center, where do we normally find cold and warm fronts
fronts do not form within the central area of a high-pressure system because air flows away from high pressure; fronts instead are found outside the high-pressure system at troughs

how to do a CTAF radio call when breaking off an approach during a circling approach
Raleigh Exec traffic, Skyhawk 53587, breaking runway 2-1 approach, entering a low left downwind for runway 3, Raleigh Exec

When an approach plate says DME/DME RNP-0.3 NA, it means that 
aircraft relying solely on DME/DME area navigation systems to meet a Required Navigation Performance (RNP) of 0.3 nautical miles are not authorized to conduct this approach.

When rolling out to a north or south heading, specifically you should roll out
at your latitude plus or minus 15 divided by 2; for Sanford, this is 35.5 + 7.5, or 43 degrees, before north or after south

according to 14 CFR 91.185, when reaching a clearance limit during lost communications:
1) If the clearance limit is a fix from which an approach begins, commence descent and approach as close as possible to the expect-further-clearance (EFC) time if one was received, or if there was no EFC time, as close as possible to the estimated time of arrival (ETA) calculated from the filed or amended estimated time en route. 2) If the clearance limit is not a fix from which an approach begins, leave the clearance limit at the EFC time if one was received, or if not, upon arrival at the clearance limit. Then proceed to a fix from which an approach begins and commence descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA as calculated from the filed or amended estimated time en route
