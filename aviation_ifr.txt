RAIM integrity monitoring
performs only horizontal consistency checks using satellites, with no vertical navigation support or real-time correction

MSA
Minimal Sector Altitude ensures 1000 feet obstacle clearance within 25 nautical miles of the navigation facility, but not acceptable navigation signal coverage; if you unexpectedly go off-course, first contact ATC, then climb to the MSA

ACS says that a pilot must fly a DME arc within
plus or minus 1 nautical mile; turn 10, twist 10

during non-precision approaches, the ACS says that navigation systems may be used to
display advisory vertical guidance

on IFR low en route chart, the north symbol on a VOR represents
magnetic north at the time the VOR was installed

on IFR low en route chart, flag with X over a point represents
 point that has a minimum crossing altitude (MCA); you must be at the altitude specified for your airway and direction, if one exists

on IFR low en route chart, if a minimum cross altitude (MCA) does not apply to your crossing and you are going to a higher altitude
you need not start your climb until you cross the intersection, then you must climb at an optimum rate up to 1000 feet below the higher altitude, then maintain a rate between 500 and 1500 feet per minute until reaching the higher altitude

on IFR low en route chart, flag with R over a point represents
a point that has a minimum reception altitude (MRA)

on IFR low en route chart, hash marks around a waypoint means

100 nautical miles

other members of the RNAV umbrella
VOR-VOR, DME-DME

snowflake on approach plate means
refer to cold temperatures document to make altitude adjustments; when super cold, altitude can read higher than we actually are due to high density of the air

approaches that require WAAS
LPV, LP; WAAS can also be used for LNAV/NVAV

LNAV+V and LP+V
are not published types of approaches; rather +V is a GPS navigator feature for vertical advisory guidance

pressure altitude equals true altitude when
standard atmospheric conditions exist (15C and 29.92)

VOR limitations
line of sight, cone of confusion, range, often broken, confusion caused by back sensing

three main components of ILS
localizer and glide slope, marker beacons or DME, approach lighting

full-scale deflection of localizer
2.5 degrees, so each dot is 0.5 degrees; width of signal is 3 to 6 degrees; 700 feet wide at runway threshold

width of ILS glide slope signal in total degrees bottom to top
1.4 degrees; range of 10 nautical miles

false glide slope issue with ILS
lobes of glide slope reflect off the ground and end up way higher, which cause the navigation system to get confused if the aircraft is too high

VOR approach with a letter rather than a runway
does not line you up with the runway, at least 30 degrees off

embedded thunderstorms are dangerous because
can't see them as you are going through the surrounding clouds

rotations of high vs. low pressure systems
high rotate clockwise; low rotate counterclockwise

how VOR works
VOR station transmits two radio signals, a stationary reference signal, and a rotating variable signal that is out of phase by the radial angle

LDA approach
like a LOC approach, but localizer is 3-5 degrees offset from the runway centerline; requires circle-to-land if offset exceeds 30 degrees; non-precision

LDA/GS approach 
provides both lateral and vertical guidance, but the final approach course is not aligned with the runway due to terrain or obstacle limitations

clear ice forms
when large, supercooled water droplets strike surface and freeze slowly; most common in cumuliform clouds or freezing rain, between 0C and -10C; hard to remove and heavy

rime ice forms
when small, supercooled water droplets freeze rapidly upon contact with the surface, trapping air bubbles; most common in stratiform clouds or light drizzle, between -10C and -20C; easier to remove and lighter and more brittle

mixed ice
combination of clear and rime

radiation fog forms when
earth loses its heat at night in the form of infrared radiation because the ground is no longer receiving sunlight; as the ground cools, the temperature of warm, moist, stationary air above it cools to the dew point; can form at daybreak

static pressure altimeter works by
comparing ambient pressure outside the aircraft through static port to the pressure inside a sealed diaphram which has a reference pressure of 29.92

airspeed indicator works by
comparing total pressure inside the Pitot tube with the ambient pressure from the static port

precession occurs with gyroscopic instruments when
a force is applied to the spinning rotor; instead of responding directly at the point of force, the gyroscope reacts 90 degrees later in the direction of rotation

steam-gauge heading indicator works by
having a vacuum pump draw air through it, spinning an internal gyroscope at high speed, which remains rigid in space due to its rotational inertia; as aircraft turns, the instrument case and compass card rotate around the stable gyroscope; the gyroscope can drift over time due to precession

preferred location of AHRS magnetometer
wingtip, as it is far from sources of magnetic disturbance

significance of a low-pressure trough on a weather map
troughs are often associated with rising air, which can lead to cloud formation, precipitation, turbulence, and wind shifts; if the air is unstable and moist, the trough can act as a trigger for convective activity

a low-pressure trough may not matter when
the air is dry and stable

air rises at a low-pressure trough because
surface winds tend to converge along the axis of lower pressure; they have nowhere to go but up; often times, troughs occur with different air masses meet, so warm, moist air will get pushed upward by cool, dry air

expected response when ATC issues an IFR clearance to pilot of airborne aircraft
read back those parts containing altitude assignments or vectors, and any part requiring verification

lightning bolt on ILS chart denotes
final approach fix for the precision approach, and also the glide slope intercept altitude

approaches to which a published VDP applies
non-precision only (those with an MDA); applies mainly to fast airplanes

on IFR low en route altitude chart, pilot-controlled lighting at an airport is denoted by
black oval or circle with the letter L inside, next to the airport's frequency; for part-time or continuous, it is often denoted with a star symbol

REIL
runway lighting that uses a pair of synchronized flashing lights, one on each side of the threshold

MALSR
set of sequenced lights installed along the extended runway centerline to lead pilot to the threshold

skidding turn is due to
more centrifugal force than the horizontal lift component

slipping turn is due to
less centrifugal force than the horizontal lift component

how to determine if GPS installed is approved for IFR en route and approaches
consult flight manual supplement

during IFR en route and terminal operations with an approved GPS, ground based facilities
must be operational along the entire route of flight; exception: WAAS-capable GPS

if you suspect hyperventilation
consciously breathe at a slower rate than normal; do not need to take deep breaths

a pilot may descend from a DA or MDA when
1) a landing can be made with a normal rate of descent and normal maneuvers; 2) visibility is not less than the minimum specified for the instrument approach procedure (subjective, but pilot could determine how many approach lights are visible at once); 3) runway or runway lights or approach lights are distinctly visible; Note: If only the approach lights are visible, the aircraft may descend to 100 feet AGL, and further descent requires that the red side row bars, or red terminating bars, or runway lights, or runway be visible immediately at that point. Note for the latter, that one does not need to be beyond the VDP

cases where a report must be submitted to the NTSB within 10 days
1) An accident involving substantial damage to the aircraft, or significant injury or death to an occupant; 2) Overdue aircraft believed to be involved in an accident; 3) Inability of a flight crew member to perform duties due to injury or illness; 4) Flight control system malfunction or failure; 5) In-flight fire; 6) In-flight aircraft collision

skidding turn is more dangerous than a slipping turn because
skidding turn has higher risk of spin because the inside (low) wing can stall first, causing the aircraft to roll and enter a spin; with a slipping turn, the outside (high) wing is more likely to stall first, often returning the aircraft to coordinated flight

IFR flight requires the following additional instruments over those for VFR: 
attitude indicator, heading indicator, turn coordinator, clock

takeoff weather minimums for IFR
part 91: no minimums; commercial: those specified for airport, then the standard minimum of 1 statute mile of visibility, lowered to half mile for aircraft with more than two engines

the FAA currently accepts different kinds of approaches to mean 
approaches with different minimums, not necessarily using different navigation systems

PTAC acronym for ATC approach clearances
P: Position: your position relative to a fix or approach segment; T: Turn: heading you should fly next; A: Altitude: altitude to maintain until established; C: Clearance: actual approach clearance

when ATC says to maintain altitude until established, this means
established on any published segment'feeder route, initial approach segment, intermediate segment, or final approach segment

a non-WAAS IFR GPS is required to have
an approved and operational alternate means of navigation appropriate for flight

RNAV refers to the capability of
various types of avionics to allow an aircraft to determine its position and fly a route based upon waypoints that have no fixed relationship with ground-based navaids

execute the missed approach procedure

characteristics of a high-pressure air mass
denser, sinking, more compressed, warmer, higher clouds

characteristics of a low-pressure air mass
less dense, rising, less compressed, cooler, lower more vertically developed clouds

the FAA and ICAO define a precision approach as one that is based on 
ground-based navigation aids providing a localizer and a glide slope; LPV is not ground-based, thus GPS approaches are all non-precision

in the context of IFR flight, resume own navigation means
to following radar vectors from ATC and to instead proceed along the previously-cleared route

Coriolis force causes winds
to bend toward the right in the Northern hemisphere, which makes them run parallel to isobars rather than perpindicular if only the pressure gradient force existed; this curving shapes large-scale wind patterns, creating westerly winds in mid-latitudes and causing clockwise circulation around highs and counterclockwise around lows in the Northern Hemisphere

at what point do we change course to avoid traffic when on IFR
should first ask advice from ATC, but can do so once you have visual contact

what should be checked before taxiing to runway with an assigned SID
that the aircraft can climb to the assigned altitude at the required climb gradient; for 172 and PA-28, can assume 500 feet per minute initial climb rate, so only check the performance charts if the SID requires more

what to do when engine out in IMC
look at glide range on ForeFlight; switch to VFR chart; work with ATC to choose a location, such as an airport or road

meaning of askterisk in S-ILS 35*
the DA requires a higher missed approach climb gradient

once established on a transition the pilot may
descend according to the published altitudes on the approach

only times do not have to report a vacated altitude
within an assigned block altitude range (including a cruise NNNN assignment), during an emergency, or responding to a traffic alert for collision avoidance

if you land at an uncontrolled airport on an IFR flight plan
you must call back ATC or FSS to cancel it; ForeFlight cannot be used to cancel an active flight plan

now, after 1000 feet

can ATC radar see clouds
no, only precipitation; but radar usually cannot see embedded thunderstorms

when does ATC normally hand us off to CTAF
radar: after being cleared for an approach, but always a second call after the readback; non-radar: after the final approach fix

how to substitude GPS for DME
stay in GPS mode, but keep second VOR receiver tuned into the VOR

a warm front moves more slowly than a cold front because 
warm air is less dense and has a harder time displacing or pushing away the denser, heavier cold air at the surface

dewpoint convergence rate
2.5C per 1000 feet

when may electronic devices be used during IFR flights
when non-commercial and the pilot in command has determined that the device will not interfere with the flight

Special VFR 
uncommonly used clearance which allows a VFR flight to enter or depart controlled airspace surrounding an airport when the weather is IFR; the weather must be at least one statue mile in visibility and the pilot must be able to stay clear of clouds; at night, the pilot must be instrument rated and aircraft must be IFR-certified

LNAV/VNAV limitations
does not get more precise as one gets closer to the runway; baro-VNAV is inherently less accirate than ILS or WAAS;

is a WAAS-capable receiver sufficient
yes, if properly certified, and thus may be used at an alternate airport; a VOR receiver is required only for a non-WAAS GPS

core feature of RNAV
can navigate along arbitrary paths through within a wide area with automatic frequency switching among multiple navaids

lost communications procedures when going missed
go to alternate, do not have to hold

if the main radios die and a portable radio can replace them
it may be used because this is an emergency

night currency requirements to carry passengers at night
3 full-stop landings from 1 hour past sundown to 1 hour before sunrise within the last 90 days

night flying time that can be logged as at night
between end of evening civil twilight (usually 30 minutes after sunday) to beginning of morning civil twilight (usually 30 minutes before sunrise)

how to determine if you are current for IFR flight
from the date of intended flight, count backward exactly 6 calendar months; you must have completed and logged the required tasks within that period

DVA
Diverse Vector Area is an airspace segment at certain airports where ATC may provide random radar vectors to an aircraft during its departure climb, even below the MVA, while still ensuring obstacle clearance; a pilot must maintain a continuous climb (usually at least 200 feet per nautical mile) until reaching the minimum vectoring altitude or minimum IFR altitude; DVAs are published in the same place as ODPs, and used in lieu of an ODP or SID

A-M-E: during an IFR lost communications situation, the altitude you should fly is
the highest of the following three altitudes: the last assigned altitude by ATC, the Minimum IFR altitude for the route segment, or the altitude ATC expected you to fly

meaning of letter A in parentheses on an IFR low en route chart
ATIS frequency

if pitot ram air source and drain hole are both blocked
indicated airspeed increases with altitude gain, decreases with altitude loss; altimeter and VSI are unaffected

if pitot ram air source is blocked and drain hold is not blocked
indicated airspeed displays zero knots; altimeter and VSI are unaffected

if only the pitot tube drain hole is plugged
indicated airspeed will work fine unless the pitot tube fills up with water

if static source is blocked
indicated airspeed decreases with altitude gain, increases with altitude loss; altimeter does not change with altitude change; VSI does not change with vertical speed change

if both pitot sources and static sources are blocked
indicated airspeed, altimeter, and VSI all remain constant, regardless of changes in airspeed, altitude, and vertical speed

why V-a decreases as weight decreases
lower weight means lower angle of attack, which means could exceed limit load factor on fixed-weight components like engine brackets, which is typically around 3.8 G's for small aircraft; for every 2% reduction in weight, decrease V-a by 1%

L/VNAV
other name for LNAV/VNAV

ATC required to do an IAP if in VMC and pilot requests it
yes, because the pilot can refuse the visual approach

ideal speed when accidentally flying through thunderstorm (such as embedded)

what reporting is required after being handed off to a class D tower
FAF inbound; reporting for the miss is the same as in a radar environment; note that radar services will be terminated during the hand-off

when should NAV2 be programmed with the ILS frequency

disorientation is still a major cause of accidents among IFR pilots; what can a pilot do when disoriented
level wings, talk to ATC

when must a pilot abide by the VDP
never, it is advisory; however it is highly recommended that a pilot not descend below the MDA until reaching the VDP and to go missed if the runway environment is not visible at the VDP; the VDP provides a 3-degree slope

when must a pilot abide by the VDA (visual descent angle)
never, it is advisory only

when deciding whether to land, how relevant are the ceilings reported by the AWOS/ATIS
ceilings are irrelevant to the landing decision, except for part 135 which must have sufficient ceilings before proceeding past the final approach fix

if you go missed very early for some reason
you must fly to the missed approach waypoint or beginning of runway before making any turns; the missed approach waypoint is a flyover waypoint; however, you can talk to ATC and see if they will let you break off early

if you break out of the clouds a little above pattern altitude, is it wise to cancel IFR
no because you may need to go missed and could end up in IMC, in which case it is illegal to not have an IFR clearance

the sky is clear and visibility is 2 statute miles, do you need to file an IFR flight plan
yes, because visibility is less than 3 statute miles

if the destination airport has no weather reporting today, may you still fly a published instrument procedure
no, but you could fly IFR to the vicinity then cancel IFR and finish the flight as VFR; further, if you notice this during planning, you must file an alternate because the airport essentially has no IAPs today

visual glide slope indicator
PAPI or VASI

MAA-8000 on an IFR chart stands for 
Maximum Authorized Altitude of 8,000 feet on that route or airway segment, which is the highest altitude at which you are assured reliable navigation signal reception along that airway

12 things that can be used to identify a runway environment when on an IFR approach

SIDs exist in order to
ensure obstacle clearance, improve traffic flow, reduce communication workload, and maintain orderly separation of departing aircraft

if heading to alternate with lost comms
just head to alternate after getting over destination runway and at a safe altitude; do not execute missed procedure; go direct to alternate unless alternate route filed

cleared for the option procedure will permit 
an instructor, flight examiner, or pilot the option to make a touch-and-go, low approach, missed approach, stop-and-go, or full-stop landing

the MDA of 530 feet for a straight-in landing always represents 
height above touchdown (HAT) since the approach is for a specific runway

MDAs for circling approaches will always represent 
height above airport (HAA) since a specific runway will not be used for landing

when does registration expire
7 years from month of registration, change of ownership, death, revocation of USA citizenship

preferred IFR route
minimizes route changes during clearance, which reduces workload for everybody

using the alternate static port causes
altimeter to read higher, airspeed to read higher, and VSI to momentarily record a climb; the cabin pressure is lower

1) passing over each reporting point in a flight point; 2) requested by ATC; 2) vacating an altitude; 3) reaching or leaving a holding fix; 4) changing altitude when VFR-on-Top; 5) initiating a missed approach; 6) TAS changes by 10 knots or 5%; 7) unable to maintain a 500 foot-per-minute climb; 8) safety issue; 9) weather different than forecast; 10) equipment malfuncion

kinds of NOTAMs
D: info that requires wide dissemination pertaining to nav aids, civic public-use airports, facilities, services, and procedures; FDC: flight info that is regulatory in nature, including changes to IFR charts, procedures, and airspace usage; Pointer: issued by an FSS to point to another NOTAM; SAA: issued when special advisory airspace will be active outside published schedule times; Military: pertain to U.S. armed forces nav aids/airports that are part of the NAS

SIGMETs
convective; severe icing; severe turbulence; IMC due to dust/sand/volcanic ash

convective SIGMET
embedded thunderstorms; a line of thunderstorms; thunderstorms greater than or equal to VIP level 4 affecting 40% or more of an area at least 3000 square miles; surface winds of 50 knots or more; hail at the surface greater than or equal to 3/4 inches in diameter; tornadoes; issued 55 minutes past the hour (except in Alaska or Hawaii); valid for 2 hours

VOR vs. ILS
VOR provides only horizontal guidance; ILS provides horizontal and vertical guidance, and much more precisely; ILS operates in only one direction along the runway; VOR can be used for any radial; ILS can be used for a single precise course and glide slope

stages of a thunderstorm
1) cumulous or developing stage - warm moist air rises; 2) mature stage - onset of precipitation; 3) dissipating stage - downdrafts dominate, precipitation weakens

in order to go missed during a circling approach after you have lined up with the intended runway
climb toward the center of the airport and execute the missed procedure

standard safety zone radii for circling approaches by aircraft category, in nautical miles
A - 1.3; B - 1.5; C - 1.7; D - 2.3; E - 4.5

standard obstacle clearance within circling approach area
300 feet

how to find the VOR test point on the ground
consult the chart supplement; some airports have signage

how to use a bearing pointer to fly a VOR approach
set bearing pointer to display VOR, steer so aircraft heading matches bearing; note that after passing over the VOR, the bearing pointer flips behind you; continue checking bearing pointer head to see if it is drifting left or right

if you can't land where missed climb gradient is higher than the aircraft can achieve
tell ATC and work out an ascent over the airport until at a safe altitude

if main radios die, using a portable radio
is allowed, but you should notify ATC of the situation

is a VOR or ILS receiver required if doing an RNAV GPS approach?
no, assuming GPS is IFR-approved and only doing a GPS-based approach; the exception is when flying a GPS approach at an alternate airport when the GPS system is non-WAAS

Visual Climb Over Airport (VCOA)
IFR departure procedure that allows a pilot to climb visually in specified VMC conditions by circling over the airport to a published altitude prior to proceeding en route; obstacles are beyond 3 statute miles from the airport

lost comms AVEF MEA acronym
A: assigned; V: vectored; E: expected; F: filed; M: miminum IFR altitude for operations for the segment (MEA, MOCA, OROCA); E: expected; A: assigned; so AVEF is for the route and MEA is for the altitude

DVFR flight plan
special VFR flight plan required while penetrating or flying within an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), such as crossing into U.S. airspace from abroad or near certain sensitive boundaries

directions along an en route chart are in terms of
magnetic north

to remain current for daytime flight under VFR, in order to fly passengers, the private pilot must
within the preceding 90 days, have performed at least 3 takeoffs and landings as the sole manipulator of the flight controls in an aircraft of the same category, class, and (if a type rating is required) type that you intend to operate; need to be to a full stop unless you are flying a tailwheel airplane

to remain current for nighttime flight under VFR, in order to fly passengers, the private pilot must
do the same as for daytime currency, except the 3 landings must occur between one hour after sunset to one hour before sunrise, and to a full stop

easiest way to file an IFR flight plan in the air when you unexpectedly encounter IMC
contact ATC and ask for a pop-up clearance; note that this adds a lot of work for them, so consider getting back on the ground and doing it there

if you are on a straight-in IFR approach and notice VFR traffic is about to cut in front of you
you may do a normal traffic pattern entry without contacting ATC; you need only re-contact ATC if you go missed in IMC

conditions under which an alternate airport without an IAP may be used
forecast at ETA must allow a descent from the MEA and landing under basic VFR conditions

when an ILS plate says that RNAV 1-GPS is required, this means that
the GPS must have sensitivity of 1 mile laterally for entry in terminal mode, and that a TAA is present; it might also say OR RADAR in which cases radar vectors may be used for entry

when an ILS plate says that DME is required for LOC
you may always use GPS in lieu of DME

if radio communications are lost during IFR flight and arrival at the clearance limit occurs before the estimated time of arrival (ETA), the initial step is to 
proceed to the fix from which an instrument approach begins (usually the initial approach fix), hold there, and time the commencement of the approach so as to arrive at the destination as close as possible to the ETA specified in the flight plan

Terminal Arrival Area (TAA) on an approach plate
provides a standardized way to transition from the en route phase to the terminal environment for aircraft using RNAV/GPS; it minimizes radio calls ith ATC and ensures obstacle clearance of 1000 feet within a 25 nautical mile radius; a TAA may include NoPT sectors; TAA may be present on some ILS plates when RNAV is required for navigation to the initial fix; pilots may descend to the published sector altitude only if they have been cleared for the approach and only if they have not been assigned a specific vectoring altitude; the TAA also tells the pilot whether a procedure turn can be avoided using NoPT

After ATC clears an aircraft for a visual approach to an untowered airport and hands it off to the CTAF frequency
the pilot remains on an IFR flight plan but is now responsible for visually navigating to the runway and maintaining separation from other aircraft while self-announcing on CTAF; the expectation is that the missed approach will either result in a second pattern circuit for landing, or the pilot will climb, remain VMC, and request instructions from ATC
In order to be assigned a visual approach
the pilot must have visual contact with the airport

In order to fly a SID
the pilot must have a textual description and ATC clearance

When a pilot is within 1000 feet of the desired altitude
the pilot should fly between 500 and 1500 feet per minute to the desired altitude; before that, the pilot should fly at the optimal climb rate for the aircraft

If you lose your attitude indicator or HSI, is that an emergency situation?
Yes, and you should report it to ATC; losing the navigation system is an even larger emergency

Does a pilot need to report entering or leaving a hold in lieu of procedure turn or other such course reversal
no, unless ATC specifically requests it

When doing a circling approach to an MDA, can you still use an LPV glide path to get down to that circling MDA
yes

It is useful to put in the initial approach fix in a filed flight plan because
1) it allows activating the approach sooner; 2) if you lose radio communications, ATC will know where you are heading

If you mistakenly enter into a thunderstorm
disable autopilot, keep the wings level, don't worry about maintaining altitude, then start to make a shallow 180-degree turn back where you came from

What to check during preflight for the presence of supercooled water droplets that could turn into structural ice
temperature profiles, passing through clouds near freezing, visible moisture, icing AIRMET or SIGMET, Current Icing Product, Forecast Icing Product, PIREPs, presence of freezing rain, weather radar and satellite data

two types of SIDs
pilot-navigation SID and vector SID; can also have a hybrid SID

VOR waypoint
based on specific radials and distances from VOR ground stations; plus or minus 4 degrees

what to include in a non-radar position report
tail number, reporting point or current position, zulu time, altitude, ETA and name of next reporting point, and possibly name or reporting point after the next; all this information was required back in the old days when there was much less radar coverage, so the information helped ATC keep track of where aircraft were and where they were going

what to include in a radar position report
tail number, current position

types of parallel runway operations
independent parallel approaches, dependent parallel approaches (staggering diagonal approaches), precision runway monitor (PRM, closely spaced runway less than 4300 feet apart, special training required)

difference between a visual approach and a contact approach
a visual approach requires the pilot to have the airport or preceding aircraft in sight, while a contact approach allows proceeding visually with reference to the ground and landmarks, even if the airport is not in sight, provided the pilot can remain clear of clouds with at least one statute mile visibility; contact must be requested by pilot and airport must have an IAP, and pilot retains squawk code

around a low-pressure center, where do we normally find cold and warm fronts
air flows inward and upward around a low-pressure system; a cold front usually extends southward or southwestward, while a warm front projects eastward or northeastward

around a high-pressure center, where do we normally find cold and warm fronts
fronts do not form within the central area of a high-pressure system because air flows away from high pressure; fronts instead are found outside the high-pressure system at troughs

how to do a CTAF radio call when breaking off an approach during a circling approach
Raleigh Exec traffic, Skyhawk 53587, breaking runway 2-1 approach, entering a low left downwind for runway 3, Raleigh Exec

When an approach plate says DME/DME RNP-0.3 NA, it means that 
aircraft relying solely on DME/DME area navigation systems to meet a Required Navigation Performance (RNP) of 0.3 nautical miles are not authorized to conduct this approach.

When rolling out to a north or south heading, specifically you should roll out
at your latitude plus the bank angle (15 for standard rate at 90 knots) divided by 2; for Sanford, this thus is 35.5 + 7.5, or 43 degrees, before north or after south

according to 14 CFR 91.185, when reaching a clearance limit during lost communications:
1) If the clearance limit is a fix from which an approach begins, commence descent and approach as close as possible to the expect-further-clearance (EFC) time if one was received, or if there was no EFC time, as close as possible to the estimated time of arrival (ETA) from the filed or amended estimated time en route. 2) If the clearance limit is not a fix from which an approach begins, leave the clearance limit at the EFC time if one was received, or if not, upon arrival at the clearance limit. Then proceed to a fix from which an approach begins and commence descent and approach as close as possible to the ETA from the filed or amended flight plan; see 91.185 for details

cruise clearance
ATC allocates block of airspace, starting at minimum IFR altitude and extends through altitude specified in clearance; may also begin approach at destination without receiving an additional approach clearance

minimum IFR altitude
minimum altitudes prescribed for flown segment, else the mountainous vs. non-mountainous rule

if both an MEA and a MOCA are prescribed for a particular route segment, a person may operate an aircraft 
lower than the MEA down to, but not below the MOCA, provided the applicable navigation signals are available; for aircraft using VOR for navigation, this applies only when the aircraft is within 22 NM of the VOR

turn-and-slip indicator shows
rate of turn only, not rate of roll

high to low, watch out below
use caution when flying from high pressure to low pressure areas; if altimeter setting is not updated, altitude will indicate higher, causing the pilot to fly lower than desired; flying from hot to cold areas results in the same error

how to go missed in PA28
hit go around button; keep autopilot engaged; will do wings level, 7 degree climb

problem with letting LNAV+V take over
need to make sure it doesn't violate stepdown altitudes, even though it normally doesn't

how to be more efficient with plates in Foreflight if there is little time
use plate binders, don't try to use smart plates

if going missed after circling toward desired runway
if doing it from downwind, do 30 degree turn toward runway, then proceed on miss course; if doing it from base or final, overfly runway upwind and climb until back to circling minimums, then do a 180 degree turn to proceed on miss course

if doing a circling approach with a strong tailwind
may need to go idle to stay on glide slope; might even need to drop gear or add flaps if very strong tailwind

fly ODP before
heading into controlled airspace

difference between 172SP vs. PA28 electrical meter
172SP shows battery charge rate (can be negative); PA28 shows positive-only current delivered by alternator

things to do once cleared for the approach
1) verify straight-in if not vectored and not explicitly mentioned; 2) delete hold if no longer applies; 3) set altimeter; 3) begin descent to TAA if applies

things to do once established on final approach course
1) begin descent to next step-down; 2) verify navaid or GPS level; 3) arm APPROACH mode on autopilot; 4) make radio call

things to do as you approach the final approach fix
1) do before landing checklist; 2) make radio call

on an approach plate, RNP APCH stands for 
Required Navigation Performance for Approach. The specification requires your GPS or RNAV system to provide continuous position monitoring and alerting — if the system can’t maintain accuracy, it must alert you

standard takeoff minimums say that a pilot should not initiate a turn after takeoff until 
reaching at least 400 feet above the departure end of runway elevation (DER)

difference in autopilot test between 172SP and PA28
try to over-power the autopilot only in the 172SP, not in the PA28

KTTA ILS approaches cannot be used as an alternate because
ILS is unmonitored

ATC sees alternate in IFR flight plan?
no

how to fix track manually
best to use the current ground track indicator on the G5, and visually drag to the proper side of current heading in order to effect the change

how to fix altitude manually
assuming the altitude was more or less ok, use a push or pull of the yoke to effect the change, then possibly the adjust the power or pitch after that (but might not need to)

difference between autopilot default start mode on 172SP and PA28
172SP defaults to ROL and VS; PA28 defaults to ROL and pitch

two ways to change to vectors to final on GTN 650
activate vectors to final or activate the leg to the final approach fix

how to recover from unusual pitched up attitude
lower nose first, then add full power

difference between being told to join the STAR vs. descend via the STAR
when joining, fly it horizontally only, maintaining assigned altitude; when descend via, use also the altitudes on the STAR

when told to join the approach
maintain the current altitude and abide by horizontal aspects of the approach; this often occurs when some other aircraft is inside the approach but ATC expects it to clear out really soon

when told to hold at a waypoint
use the course you are currently on for the inbound leg, then make a standard-rate turn when crossing the fix to proceed outbound

when hitting the go-around button on the PA28
autopilot will pitch up 7 degrees, go wings level, so must engage NAV and IAS modes

KTTA takeoff limits
for runway 3, do not turn right until 1100 feet; for runway 21, do not turn left until 1500 feet; this is all related to the big tower

on an IFR low en route chart, a class D airspace is shown
using a dashed circle, similar to on a VFR chart

why file to an initial approach fix?
makes lost communications handling easier

if you have one G5 non-operational, should you declare an emergency?
no, but you should report the inoperative G5

you may fly a DME arc without DME if
you fly the arc with a GPS, then switch to VOR for the inbound leg

when ATC instructs you to Maintain 300 knots, descend pilot’s discretion, maintain 7000
you are cleared to descend from 15,000 feet to 7,000 feet at your discretion, provided you maintain 300 knots throughout the descent until speed limits or further instructions apply, such as 250 knots below 10,000 feet

radius of a TAF
5 statute miles

the leans can lead to
a graveyard spiral 

when the engine air intake gets blocked by ice or other
the engine will lose power and may quit altogether; most engines will automatically open an alternate intake door

if a backup instrument is inoperative, you should look at the
STC for the aircraft, which will normally say that the instrument is required

zig-zag line through an airway means that
it is closed, usually due to an inoperative VOR

problems with filing direct, particularly over mountains
off-route, lost comms, gonna get a different clearance anyway, not ideal for traffic flow, unpublished hold above destination, recommended route is not necessarily safe, maybe add initial approach fix to route even you have to hold there

winds aloft forecast comes out at
00Z and 12Z

on an IFR Low En Route Chart, a green square drawn around a class B airspace area indicates 
availability of a Terminal Area Chart (TAC) for that region

you may pick up your IFR clearance 
up to about 10 minutes before your proposed taxi time at towered airports, and typically no more than 30 minutes before takeoff at non‑towered fields when a clearance void time applies

there is no weather reporting today at yourdestination, can still you still fly an instrument approach procedure?
yes, using the nearby altimeter setting with any additional restrictions, but you must file an alternate that does have weather reporting according to alternate minimums

in our PA28 and M20J with the more advanced GFC 500 or higher autopilot, the go-around button will
put the autopilot in roll and pitch mode and also active the GPS

where to look for icing forecasts
SIGMET Z, AIRMET Z, icing and freezing levels page on the GFA tool

three times ATC will give you during a release for departure
release time (usually now), void time, and contact time; note that you must be wheels up before the void time

if ATC gives you a heading for takeoff, they will normally say:
upon entering controlled airspace, and then they will assume control of your navigation

standard ODP requirements
at least 35 feet above the departure end of the runway; at least 200 feet per nautical mile; no turns until 400 feet AGL

where might one see a graphical ODP
in mountainous areas

what non-standard takeoff minimums might a pilot see
increased visibility or ceiling requirements; higher climb gradients; notes for specific runways, such as must go wheels up a certain distance before the departure end of the runway

if ATC does not give you a departure frequency, it normally means
it is listed in the assigned SID

difference between being told to fly a SID vs. climb via the SID
if just flying the SID, maintain altitude assigned by ATC; if climb via the SID, follow the published altitudes on the SID

how does ATC typically assign a block altitude range
maintain block 8000 through 10000

in which contexts are block altitudes typically used
when a pilot needs to avoid turbulence or icing; and for high-altitude performance margin; block altitudes are typically assigned for brief stretches of the route in order to avoid tying up airspace

what are the advantages of a VFR on Top clearance
you can choose your appropriate VFR altitudes to more easily avoid clouds, ice, turbulence, etc; you do not need approval from ATC for these altitudes as long as you maintain VFR

can you fly in IMC in uncontrolled airspace without an IFR clearance
yes, it's legal, but also deemed reckless, so don't do it ever

one key difference between what you find on a STAR vs. what you find on a SID
STARs often have speed restrictions

things ATC can give you as part of an unpublished hold 
holding fix; cardinal direction from fix; along radial, bearing, route or airway; leg length; direction of turns, EFC time; if ATC does not give you a direction, you should hold on this side of the fix

how ATC might give you get a published or charted hold
ATC tells you to proceed to a certain waypoint and hold as published; they might give you an EFC time or an altitude as well

can you enter the unprotected area of a hold
it can happen after you are crosss the holding fix to enter a parallel hold, but you should minimize it

turns during holds should be
standard-rate turn of 3 degrees per second or 30 degrees bank, whichever is less

how to calculate the bank angle for a standard rate turn
15% of TAS

during a check ride or intrument proficiency check, LPV is considered
a precision approach

the GTN 650 annunciates a yellow LPV, this means that
it is trying to provide LPV level GPS, but it won't know until right before you get to the final approach fix whether it is possible

on an IFR low en route chart, in the VOR information box, what does 121.1R mean?
flight service (FSS) broadcasts voice on the VOR frequency and receives your requests on 121.1; you should initially indicate your tail number, your position, the VOR name (under the box), and which frequencies you are transmitting and receiving on

when a VOR frequency on an IFR low en route chart has a line under it, this means that
the VOR does not transmit any voice on this frequency, only navigation signal and Morse code; look above the VOR information box to see if there is an FSS frequency you can use

after the VOR identifier in a VOR information box, there can be a second frequency, which is
the DME frequency; but that frequency is always determined from the VOR frequency, so a VOR receiver with DME can always determine it from the VOR frequency alone; if the DME frequency has a (Y) after it, then there is a slightly different pulse spacing and shifted frequency spacing than the typical 63 MHz of separation

pitch control and performance instruments
use the attitude indicator to set the pitch, then cross-check using the altitmeter, vertical speed indicator (VSI), and airspeed indicator

bank control and performance instruments
use the attitude indicator to set the bank angle, then cross-check using the heading indicator, turn coordinator, and compass

from 1000 to 14500 feet AGL: 40; from 14500 to 18000 feet AGL: 100; from 18000 to 45000 feet: 130; from 45000 to 60000 feet: 100

VOR low (VL) nautical mile ranges (newer)

VOR high (VH) nautical mile ranges (newer)
from 1000 to 5000 feet AGL: 70; from 5000 to 14500 feet AGL: 70; 14500 to 18000 feet AGL: 100; 18000 to 45000 feet AGL: 130; 45000 to 60000 feet AGL: 100

what does (VL) (L) mean in a VOR information box?
VOR Low for the VOR, legacy low for the DME component

when you go miss, if you don't hit the activate missed approach button
the needle will still be tied to the overly-sensitive approach which will make it harder to stay on course

if you need to lose 50 to 100 feet of altitude
pitch down slightly using the yoke; inverse for gaining 50 to 100 feet

if you need to lose 500 feet of altitude
lower power and pitch down to get it started; then gradually reduce forward pressure; inverse for gaining 500 feet

to level off
add power and a little back pressure to help it

angle of attack controls
airspeed, so don't fiddle with trim if speed already good

ideal descent rate for step-downs
600 to 700 feet per minute

ideal time to id the navaid
before crossing the inbound way point

during partial panel when one G5 is off, be sure not to
turn the heading knob because it is really the baro setting

best way to set pitch
first with yoke, then trim pressure off hands

the CDI on the GTN 650 is
GPS-driven, even for ILS

when climbing out
set pitch for climb-out speed and don't worry about what the VSI says

before reporting inbound to ATC
start down to the next step-down altitude

how to know on map when it's time to go down to the next step-down altitude
the magenta line on the map will change to the next segment

when off course
just stop track from moving away from desired track, then nudge it back

on final approach, the GTN 650 screen that is most helpful is
the default nav page; the map page isn't as useful at that point

after making course corrections, check for wings level
using the attitude indicator

when entering a hold from what looks like a tear drop entry, but is really a direct entry
make a slower, wider turn

when you get to the MDA and don't see the runway environment
stay at the MDA until the missed approach point because you might see it soon; the only exception is if you have a 3/4 scale deflection in which case you must go missed

if you are not IFR current, you may not
file an IFR flight plan, thus you need to go fly some approaches under the hood with an instructor or safety pilot, or use a certified simulator

can you do an instrument proficiency check in a simulator?
no

when an approach place has NA written next to the A symbol in the notes, this means that
this approach is not authorized when the airport is used as an alternate; likely no weather reporting or unmonitored ILS

what does it mean if there is a red X over our G5?
ADC went bad

features of our planes for icing
pitot heat, carb heat (PA28), cabin heat can be blown on the windshield

with reverse sensing, CDI shows
aircraft relative to course rather than VOR relative to course

limitations of weather tools in the airplane
15 minute delay in constructing data at the server and up to 15 minute delay getting it updated in the airplane; if weather changing fast, could be looking at very out-of-date information

can you do an RNAV GPS approach without an HSI?
no, need to request ILS

what happens if you do not have a transponder and want to fly IFR?
must tell this to ATC when they give you your clearance, may not be able to fly in places where it is required

on an ILS approach, do you have to be able to identify the markers?
no, most don't have them

difference between solid and hollow arrows on an IFR low en route chart?
solid arrow mean the fix is determined by a specific navaid's radial; hollow indicates the fix is defined by a DME distance from a certain navaid

may an IPC be conducted in a certified simulator?
not in a BATD like ours, but in more advanced simulators; and obviously a CFII or other representative must be present

what cruise altitude should be filed in an IFR flight plan?
minimum appropriate IFR altitude for the first leg

what is the default void time?
30 minutes after release time

what is a GCO?
ground communication outlet: old-school way of using the radio to connect to ATC on the ground at an uncontrolled airport; no longer relevant with cell phones

whom to file a PIREP with?
ATC or FSS

after requesting delay vectors from ATC
you must let ATC when you are ready to fly the approach

guidelines for making directional changes when flying an approach
before the final approach fix, it's ok to make up to 7-10 degrees of change; after the final approach fix, no more than 3-5 degrees

if you go full-scale deflection on the approach
you must immediately go missed

ranges for ILS localizer and glide slope
localizer: 18 nautical miles and within 10 degrees of centerline; glide slope: 10 nautical miles

how much to level out above DA or MDA during check ride
30 to 40 feet

LPV vs. LNAV/VNAV precision
LPV: 200 feet AGL, 1/2 mile visibility, 700 feet course width at threshold; LNAV/VNAV: 250 to 400 feet AGL, linear course width throughout

new MOSAIC rules
weight limits removed, up to 4 seats, maximum stall speed of 61 knots, maximum speed of 250 knots, broader aircraft types, retractable landing gear, constant-speed propellers, night flights, must have a non-pressurized cabin, should be able to glide when engine out

elevator illusion
feeling of pitching up or down during upgraft or downdraft

magnetic dip occurs because
Earth's magnectic flux lines are not parallel to the surface except at the equator; instead, they incline downward toward the Earth in the northern hemisphere; a compass needle in the northern hemisphere will tilt downard; this cases errors when in a bank

where can IFR preferred routes be found
chart supplements, FAA preferred routes database

TORA
take-off runway available from ground release to point of liftoff

TODA
TORA plus length of any clearway (free of obstacles)

ASDA 
accelerate-stop distance available, which is TORA + length of any stopway

LDA 
landing distance available, from landing threshold to end of runway (excluding displaced threshold)

landing distances that should be calculated prior to checkride
TORA, TODA, ASDA, LDA, then compared with performance data of the aircraft

ATC may assign vectors and altitudes only
within controlled airspace

standard altitudes to fly
below 18,000 feet or uncontrolled airspace: odd and even thousands of feet; above 18,000 feet: use odd and even flight livels like FL180; above FL290, there are 4000 feet differences

mode C transponder is required
at or above 10000 feet MSL over 48 contiguous states or DC excluding airspace below 2500 AGL, within 30 miles of class B primary airport, within and above all class C airspace up to 10000 feet MSL, within 10 miles of certain designated airports excluding outside class D surface area and below 1200 AGL, ADIZs

when a transponder is required
must have ADSB-out, including mode C

difference between part 91 and commercial landing visibility requirements
part 91: must have required flight visibility; commercial: must have reported visibility before reaching final approach fix

when can you transition from IFR to VFR flight plan?
when in basic VFR conditions

when can you use VFR for an alternate
when you can descend from an MEA in basic VFR conditions all the way to the landing

after your void time, how long until search and rescue operation begin?
30 minutes

the contact time applies only if
you do not depart

when you should get your clearance on the ground
when you are not sure you will be able to stay in VMC before getting it in the air

MVA
minimum vectoring altitude is lowest altitude at which ATC can vector IFR aircraft while providing standard obstacle and terrain clearance; determined by sector; in some locations, may be lower than published MEAs or MOCAs; MVAs are not provided MVA charts, but must comply

0.5 to 1 mile before each waypoint on an approach
start doing what comes next: identify nav aids, arm approach mode on autopilot, set next altitude bug, pre-landing checklist, radio calls

do not break off and start circling until
you can see the runway environment; during check ride, this means the examiner tells you to take off your hood; otherwise fly to the missed approach point and begin the missed approach

once autopilot approach mode is engaged and on the glide slope
monitor speed closely and also monitor that autopilot remains engaged

during the final segment of the approach
sensitivity increases greatly, so be sure to make very small changes to get back on course of the approach

in the 172, when capturing the current altitude
do not change the altitude bug, otherwise you'll need to fight with VS mode

on the final leg, the glide slope is very sensitive, so
make smaller and more immediate changes in descent rate by changing attitude by 1 degree; speed will not change that much

the type of holding entry procedure (parallel, teardrop, or direct) is determined by
the sector holding the aircraft's position

in our airplanes, the top G5 is a primary instrument only for
the attitude indicator

to fly a STAR, a pilot must have
ATC clearance, the current STAR chart, required avionics

for an approach lighting system symbol (A1, A4) etc. with a dot over it, the dot means that
there are sequenced flashing lights leading up to the runway

with a procedure turn barb, the turn inbound
may be left or right, but it is better to choose the direction furthest away from the runway

which radio picks up the marker beacon signals
the audio panel; the signal uses the same frequency; faster, higher-pitched whiter beeps are for the inner beacon

when might a pilot when to turn on runway lights
obviously at night, but also during the day when there is low visibility

what is the purpose of the altitude listed for the final approach fix?
it allows a double check that the pilot has the correct altimeter setting dialed in

TDL/CL on approach plate
touchdown zone lighting, center line lighting

upper right number on approach plate
date of latest rev of chart; 2-5-2-1-9 means 2025, 219th day of the year

AMDT on lower left part of approach plate
means minor amendment to the plate

the circling MDA protected area extends from
the runway threshold; when the approach plate shows the reverse C, you will need to consult the table to determine the cirling radius for your aircraft, but you shouldn't need it because you should always stay close to the runway

when starting an approach at an intermediate fix
ATC must give you an angle that is less than 90 degrees; you should advise ATC you are at the intermediate fix; ATC must radar monitor you

approved vertical guidance
LPV and LNAV/VNAV; can fly down to DA

with a full-scale deflection
you must immediately commit to going missed, which may mean first flying to the missed approach point

trick to remembering things that must be visble in the runway environment
physical thing, its markings, and its lights; this applies to threshold, touchdown zone, and runway; then you can add in PAPI and red lights at the end of the approach lighting system

with a VOR approach that does not specify GPS, the pilot using GPS to navigate the course must 
still monitor the underlying VOR on nav2 or nav1

what does it mean to be established on a localizer?
the needle must be registering consistently and some say no more than half-scale deflection; it is not very well specified

with a WAAS-equipped aircraft, are VOR checks required?
for ILS, no; if just monitoring a VOR, no

what is a practical reason why you would want to fly a circling approach
to save time if approaching the airport from the opposite side of the landing runway; you don't want to have to fly all the way out to an initial approach fix for the landing runway

when planning an alternate assuming RNAV GPS, you must look at the predicted cloud ceilings and visibility
relative to the maximum of the 800/2 or the LNAV minimums; similar for ILS planning

if WAAS goes out during an approach
it should downgrade immediately to LNAV; if you are below the MDA, go missed immediately

when using LNAV+V for vertical advisory guidance
trust, but verify; must still use LNAV minimums, obviously

RNP-AR approach
authorization and training are required; we can't use such an approach

for RNAV 21 at KTTA with an LPV annunciation on the GTN 650
we can go down to the lower LNAV/VNAV DA because we WAAS; LNAV/VNAV DA is lower than LPV DA due to the way they are calculated by the FAA; it's an anomaly

icing conditions when flying through
visible moisture down to -20 degrees Celsius

FIKI
flight into known icing

how far away should you stay from thunderstorms
at least 20 nautical miles

thunderstorms look distant, but there is still the danger
of gust fronts that occur due to falling cold air under the storm

AIRMETs
S: sierra - extensive mountain obscuration or IFR (less than 1000 ft and/or visibility less than 3 miles affecting over 50% of the area at one time); T: tango - moderate turbulence or sustained surface winds of 30 kts or more; Z: zulu - moderate icing

if you get an equipment failure you should
notify ATC, indicating how it affects your IFR flight and whether you need any assistance

how to determine your personal minimums
need to answer: what have you done lately and what plane did you do it in?; for a newly-minted pilot, I will use 1500 foot ceilings for planning, then must break out of the clouds at 1000 feet AGL when I actually fly the approach or take off

when making an emergency landing at night on a road
a wider road will normally have fewer wires and more room; also better to get off the road quickly
