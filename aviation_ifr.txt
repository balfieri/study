alternate required when
destination has no instrument approach procedure, even if in VFR

you may use a GPS approach at the alternate as long as 
there is a ground-based NAVAUD and airborne receiver to use as a backup

right bracket on a weather depiction chart indicates 
the station is an automated observation location

large areas of land tend to 
increase temperature variations
