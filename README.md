This repository contains a Python3 script called "run" that will test you based on questions from a text file of your creation. It will randomly select questions and you must type the answers exactly. 

It will re-test the questions that you missed.

There are a few text files provided for various topics of my interest. Feel free to use them or add your own:

italian.txt<br>
french.txt<br>
aviation.txt<br>
weather.txt - aviation weather symbols<br>

Example of running the italian questions:

    ./run italian
