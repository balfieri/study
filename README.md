This repository contains a Perl script called "run" that will test you based on phrases in a text file of your creation. It will randomly select phrases and you must type the answers exactly. 

It has a nice feature where it will re-test the questions that you missed.

There are three text files provided for various topics of my interest:

italian.txt 
french.txt
aviation.txt - except for weather
weather.txt - aviation weather shorthands (there are many)

To run, say, the italian questions, you type:

run italian
