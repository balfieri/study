This repository contains a Python3 script called run.py that will test you based on questions from a text file of your creation. It will randomly select questions and you must type the answers exactly (but upper/lower case is ignored). 

It will re-test the questions that you missed.

There are a few text files provided for various topics of my interest. Feel free to use them or add your own:

italian.txt<br>
french.txt<br>
aviation.txt<br>

Example of running the italian questions:

    ./run.py italian

This is all open-source.  Refer to the LICENSE.md for licensing details.  

By the way, there is a roundabout way to run this on iOS. Use an app called Working Copy to clone this git repo, then use another app called PyTo to run the Python interpreter on iOS. You will need to enable Working Copy to be a Files "location" in order for PyTo to see the repo on your phone.  Once it's set up, you just need to "git pull" the repo occasionally. It's a pain to type answers on iOS, so you may want to go for 100 questions and just say the answer to yourself.
